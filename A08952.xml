            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>The Preface of the Author to the Treatiſe following.</head>
               <p>MOST deare ſiſter in Chriſt you haue entreated me a long time, that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:14161:12"/> I would write ſome thing for you, which might animate you in the way of perfection. But for that (according to the old prouerbe) it is pride to vndertake to teach any one that is better then our ſelues, I haue thought my ſelfe vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to take ſo great a matter in hand, and therfore I haue long deferred, to doe that which you haue demaunded. But becauſe you haue againe and againe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated me; I haue on the other ſide cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to mind the ſentence of our Lord, ſaying: * Woſoeuer will force thee one mile, goe with him other twaine: and to euerie one that asketh thee giue. (L V C. 6.) Being thus on euerie ſide anxious, at length, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by your charitie, and aſſiſted by your prayers, I haue gathered together certaine crummes from vnder the table of the Fathers, and albeit not ſo well as I ought, yet as well as I haue beene able,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:14161:12"/> which in this booke I represe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnto you.</p>
               <p>Now therefore (moſt deare ſiſter) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept this little Treatiſe, and place it, as a mirrour before your eies, and be alwaies looking vpon it, as vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> à looking glaſſe. For Gods precepts are as it were looking glaſſes, in which our ſoules ought to be alwayes looking, to mark the ſpots of their impuritie whatſoeuer they be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no man is altogither cleane from the filth of iniquitie: by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> likewiſe they do amend the faults of their cogitations, and adorne their bright countenance, as it were by beholding their owne image: becauſe whiles they applie themſelues to our Lords precepts with their whole attentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they doubtleſſe know by them, what is pleaſing or diſpleaſing in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, to their celeſtial bridegroome.</p>
               <p>Wherefore I admonish you (venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſiſter) to read this booke with a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling mind, yea to read it ouer againe and againe, and thereby you shall know
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:14161:13"/> how to loue God &amp; your neighbour, how to deſpiſe all earthly and tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſitorie thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>My beloued ſiſter in Chriſt, let your wiſdome peruſe this booke with due care and diligence, and daily lament my faults and offenſes. That albeit I am vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to obtaine forgiuenes, yet by your holy prayers I may merit pardon of my ſinnes. Almightie God keepe and preſerue you (venerable ſiſter) from all euill, and bring you, with all thoſe that ſerue him in your companie, to life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall. Amen.</p>

               <head>Of faith. CHAPTER I.</head>
               <p>OVR Lord ſaieth in the Ghoſpel: * All things are poſſible to him that beleeueth (MARC. 9.) No man can attaine to eternall bliſſe, but by faith. Howbeit he is bleſſed, that rightly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth, and by rightly beleeuing, liueth well, and by liuing well, obſerueth the right faith. Wherevpon bleſſed Iſidorus ſaieth: Without faith no man can pleaſe God. Faith is not e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forced out of any one by violence, but perſuaded by reaſon and examples For they, from whome it is violently exacted, cannot perſeuere in it.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:14161:14"/> As for examples ſake: a young tree, if the top thereof be violently bowed downe, aſſoone as it is let goe, returneth forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with into his former place againe. * Faith vvithout workes is dead. (Ia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 2.) and he flatereth himſelfe of onely faith to little purpoſe, that is not adorned with good workes.</p>
               <p>He that carrieth his Croſſe, muſt die to the world: for to carrie the croſſe, is to mortifie himſelfe. To carrie the croſſe &amp; not to die, is but a point of hypocriſie. * Whoſoeuer ſhall not, ſtagger in his heart but beleeue that watſoeuer he ſaieth ſhall be done: it ſhall be done vnto him. (LVC. 11.) * He that beleeueth in the ſonne of God hath life euerlaſting but he that is incredulous to the Sonne, ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath of God remaineth vpon him (IO. 8.) * Euen as the bodie without the ſpirit is dead, ſo alſo faith without workes is dead. (Iam. 2.)</p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:14161:14"/>
               <p>Moſt deare ſiſter, great doubtleſſe is the dignitie of faith, howbeit without charitie, it is nothing worth. Wherefore venerable ſiſter, preſerue in you the right faith, hold the true faith: keepe the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted faith, let the right faith remaine in you let the faith of an vncorrupt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion be in you. Speake nothing rashly of Chriſt, thinke or imagine nothing of God that is wicked or lewd, leaſt you offend his loue. Be vpright in faith, haue a holy conuerſation in a right faith, and denie not God by your workes, on whome you call by your faith. Euill mixt with good doth defile many things. One thing that is bad, doth corrupt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that are good. Being perfect in faith, offend not in your actions. Defile not your faith by liuing amiſſe. Corrupt not the integritie of your faith by your bad manners. Mingle not vice with vertue, adioyne not euill to good. Louing ſiſter God preſerue you in health. Amen.</p>

               <head>Of hope. CHAP. II.</head>
               <p>* OVR Lord ſaith in the Ghoſpell, Haue confidence, feare, lye not. (MATH. 14.) * Hope that is ſeene, is not hope, for that which a man ſeeth, wherefore doth he hope it? But if we hope for that which we ſe not, we expect by patience. (ROM. 8.) Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon Salomon ſaieth. * The expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the iuſt is ioy, but the hope of the impious ſhall periſh. (PROV. 10.) Therefore moſt deare ſiſter, do you like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe expect our Lord, and depart from euill, and he will exalt you in the day of his viſitation, that is at the day of your death, or at the day of doome.</p>
               <p>They that ceaſe not to commit ſinne
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:14161:15"/> do expect Gods mercie in vaine: which they might expect well, if they would depart from euill. Wherevpon bleſſed Iſidorus ſaith: We ought to feare, leaſt through the hope which God promiſeth vs, we perſiſt in doing amiſſe. Neither muſt we againe deſpaire of Gods mercie and compaſſion, for that he doth ſtrictly reſtraine vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſinne: but (which is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) let vs eſchew both theſe dangers, by shunning ſinne, &amp; by Gods pittie hoping for pardon. For euerie iuſt man labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth betweene hope and feare: for that one while hope maketh him ioyful, an otherwhile the horrour of hell maketh him fearefull. For he that deſpaireth of the pardon of his ſinne, doth more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne himſelfe by deſpaire, then by the euill he hath done.</p>
               <p>Wherefore beloued ſiſter, let your hope be firme in Chriſt Ieſus your bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grome, becauſe mercie ſhall compaſſe
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:14161:16"/> hoſe about, that hope in our Lord. (Pſal. 10.) * Hope firmelie in our Lord, and doe good, inhabit the earth, and (in his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly kingdome) you ſhall be fed with his riches. (pſalm. 26.) Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſiſter, lay aſide iniuſtice, and hope in Gods mercie &amp; compaſſion, caſt aſide iniquitie, and hope for ſaluation. Amend your ſelfe, and hope in Gods mercie. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell from you wickednes, and hope for forgiuenes. Correct your life, and hope for life euerlaſting: to which he vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to bring you, who hath choſen you before the world began. Amen.</p>

               <head>Of the grace of God. CHAP. III.</head>
               <p>THE Apoſtle S. Paul ſaieth: * Where ſinne abounded, grace did more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound: that as ſinne reigned to death
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:14161:16"/> death, ſo alſo grace may reigne by iuſtice to life euerlaſting. (Rom. 5.) * For the ſtipends of ſinne are death, but the grace of God, life euerliſting. (Rom. 6.) * But to euerie one of vs is giuen grace according to the meaſure of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Chriſt (Ephes. 4.) Moſt deare ſiſter, according as S. Iſidorus ſaith. Ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s going forward, is the guift of God. If therefore we goe forward by the guift of God, it is requiſit, that in reſpect of our good workes we praiſe not our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, but God: neither can any one be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended of himſelfe, but of God. Man hath no good thing, that is properly his owne, whoſe way is not his owne accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the Prophet doth affirme, who ſaith: * I know Lord, that mans way is not his owne, neither is it in à man to walke, and to direct his ſtepps (IERE. 10.) VVhen he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth any guift, let him ſeeke no more

For he diſturbeth the whole order of the bodie, who being not content with his owne office, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to get <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>at which belongeth vnto an other.</p>
               <p>In the diuiſion of guifts, men receiue diuerſe guifts of God. Neither are all guifts granted vnto one man, but for humilities ſake God hath ordained this order, that one may haue that, whereby he may be admired in an other. For the viſion of Ezechiel (chap. 3.) concerning the winges of liuing creatures, ſtriking one againſt an other, doth ſignifie the vertues of holy men, prouoking one an other by mutual affection, and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting one an other by ſucceſſiue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.</p>
               <p>Moreouer honeſt virgin, I would not
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:14161:17"/> haue you ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that without the afore going, accompanying, and aſſiſting grace of God, we can doe no good. The grace of God doth preuent vs, that we may deſire good, is doth accompany vs, that we may begin good, it doth coope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate with vs, that we may performe good. From God therefore is giuen vs a good will, a beginning, and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance. From God are giuen vs vertues, but vices and ſinnes do ariſe from our ſelues. Charitie, modeſtie and chaſtitie are giuen vs from God: but pride, aua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, and couetouſnes, are from our ſelues. Without God we can doe no good, but by Gods grace we can doe ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>y good things. Without the grace of God we are ſlow, dull, and tepid to doe any thing that is good, but by Gods grace we become gratefull, and carefull and deuout in good workes. Without God we are readie preſently to commit
<pb facs="tcp:14161:18"/> ſinne, but by the grace of God we are freed from the ſame. Without God we affect earthly and tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſitorie things more then is fitting, but by the grace of God we deſpiſe whatſoeuer is in this world, and deſire heauen. We are excluded our of paradiſe for the ſinne of the firſt man, but by the grace of God we hope to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine thither againe. By the ſinne of the firſt man we deſcend into hell, but by the grace of God we hope to aſcend in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heauen, For if we be potent, rich or wiſe, we ought to aſcribe it wholy to Gods grace. Yea I would haue you know (moſt reuerend ſiſter) that all good things, which we haue in this world, we haue by the grace of God. For all euills or miſeries happen vnto vs for our ſinnes: howbeit God by his holy mercie and grace giueth vs good things. Croſſes and calamities befall vs for our ſinnes, but our proſperitie proceedeth from
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:14161:18"/> Gods grace. Aduerſities befall vs for our iniquities, but by Gods grace all things neceſſarie are beſtowed vpon vs, and for our vices aduerſities do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall vs.</p>
               <p>Wherefore ô ſpouſe of Chriſt, it is verie requiſite, that we continually call to mind with all thankfullnes of heart, the benefits, which we haue receiued from God. Wherevpon the Church in the Canticles ſpeaketh of Chriſt her bridegroome, ſaying: * We will reioyce and be glad in thee, mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of thy breaſtes aboue wine: the righteous loue thee (Cant. I.) As if-ſhee ſhould ſay: Being mindfull of thy grace, mercie, and benefits they loue thee: that is, they loue thee that are right of heart.</p>
               <p>They are right of heart, who attribute nothing to their owne merits in reſpect of their iuſtice or holines, but aſcribe all
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:14161:19"/> to the guift of thy grace. Being mindful of thy grace, by which they are ſaued, they loue thee.</p>
               <p>Honeſt virgin, be allwayes mindfull, that whatſoeuer good is in you, is from the grace of God. Heare S. Paul the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, ſpeaking of himſelfe: * By the grace of God, I am that which I am: (1. Cor. 15.) ſo you likewiſe (moſt deare ſiſter) by the grace of God are that, which you are. For your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the world, your forſaking the houſe of your father, your vouchſafing to be the handmaid of God, your deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate reſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſerue God in religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and laſtly your ſolemne vow or Profeſſion to liue amongſt Gods hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maids, all theſe benefits haue hapned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you by meanes of God grace. For in that you are a Virgin, and prudent and wiſe, it doth not procede from your ſelfe, but from Gods grace.</p>

               <p>A queſtion. Tell me I pray you, deare brother, what meaneth that which we read in holy Write, that no man is good, iuſt, or holy, ſauing God onely?</p>
               <p>The anſwere. Deare ſiſter, euen as it is written, ſo it is truly: God onely is good, iuſt, and holy; because he is good by himſelfe: but men are good, not by themselues, but by God: and therefore God onely is good, becauſe he is good by himſelf. Howbeit men are good, iuſt, and holy; not by themſelues, but by the grace of God almightie. Which thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the bridegroome of the Church Chriſt Ieſus doth verie well ſignifie in the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, ſaying: * I am the flower of the field, and the lilly of the valley, (Cant. 2.) for that I ſpread abroad the ſweet ſauour of my vertue throughout whole world. I, ſaith he, am the flower of the Field &amp; the lilie of the valley: that is, I am the holines, goodnes, and iuſtice
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:14161:20"/> of thoſe, who with humilitie truſt in me: Becauſe none of them can he holy, good, or iuſt without me, euen as I haue ſaid in the Goſpel: * Becauſe without me you ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doe nothing. (Io. 15.) I am the Flower of the Field, and lilie of the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley. (Cant. 2.) For like as a Field is ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and beautified with flowers: ſo the whole world is adorned and beautified with the Faith &amp; knowledge of Chriſt. I am the Flower of the Field and lilie of the valley: becauſe I do giue my grace to thoſe men more amplie, who truſt not in their owne goodnes, nor in their owne merits, but in me.

                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:14161:25"/> God (Ec. 25.) The feare of God is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his loue. O deare ſiſter, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doth ſo keepe vs free from ſinne, as the feare of hell, and the loue of God. To feare God is to commit no ſinne, and to omit no good that is to be done. * The feare of our Lord is a fountaine of life. (Prou. 14.) * With him that feareth our Lord it ſhall be well in the later end, and in the day of his death he ſhall be bleſſed. (Eccli. 1.)</p>
               <p>Venerable ſiſter, it is good for vs to feare God, becauſe the feare of our Lord expelleth ſinne. The feare of our Lord doth alwayes amend. The feare of our Lord doth repreſſe vice. The feare of our Lord doth make a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and ſollicitous: but where there is not feare, there is perdition of ſoule. Where there is not feare, there is diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of life: where there is not feare, there is abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dance of ſinnes. Therefore
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:14161:25"/> honeſt virgin, let feare &amp; hope alwayes be in your heart: let feare &amp; confidence be ioyntly in your. Let hope and feare perſeuere equally in you. So hope in Gods mercie, that you feare his iuſtice. Howbeit (moſt louing ſiſter in Chriſt) I would haue you to know, that there are foure feares: to wit, humane, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile, initial, and chaſt. Humane feare (as Caſſiadorus ſaith) is, when we feare to ſuffer corporal dangers, or to looſe our earthly ſubſtance, for which we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend. This wordly feare is naught, and in the firſt degree is forſaken with the world, and by our Lord is for bidden in the Goſpel, ſaying: * Feare ye not them that kill the bodie &amp;c. (Mat. 10.)</p>
               <p>The ſecond feare is ſeruile, as S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine ſaith: Through the feare of hell a man departeth from ſinne, and all the good workes, which he doeth, he doeth not for the loue of God, but for the feare of hell. He feareth as a ſeruant, who
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:14161:26"/> doeth the good, which he doeth, not for feare of looſing the good, which he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oueth not, but for feare of ſuffering the euill, which he feareth. He feareth not to looſe the embracements of his moſt beautifull bridegroome, but leaſt he be throwne downe leadlong into the paines of eternal perdition. Of this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile feare S. Paul ſaieth: * You haue not receiued the ſpirit of ſeruitude a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in feare: but you haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the ſpirit of adoption of ſonnes. (Rom. 8.) that is, a filial ſpirit. This ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile feare is good and profitable, allbeit vnſufficient and vnperfect, by which the cuſtome of iuſtice doth encreaſe by little and little.</p>
               <p>When a man beginneth to beleeue the day of iudgement, he beginneth to feare. If he beginneth to beleeue, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth likewiſe to feare: but for that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e feareth, he hath not yet a perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:14161:26"/> in the day of iudgement. Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is not yet perfect in him, that as yet feareth: becauſe if charitie where per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in him, he would not feare. Perfect charitie would cauſe in a man perfect iuſtice, and a man would haue no cauſe to feare: but he would haue iuſt cauſe to deſire, that iniquitie may paſſe, and the kingdome of God may come. What is perfect charitie, but perfect ſanctitie? He hath in himſelfe perfect charitie, that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth perfectly. He that liueth perfectly, hath nothing whereby to be damned in hell, but rather whereby to be crowned in heauen. He that hath perfect charitie in himſelfe, feareth not to be puniſhed in hell, but hope<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h to glorie with God in heauen. Wherevppon it is ſaid in the pſalme: * All that loue thy name ſhall glorie in thee. (Pſal. 5.) Feare there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is not in charitie, but perfect cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie driueth forth feare. Feare firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:14161:27"/> into the heart of man, that a place may be prepared for charitie.</p>
               <p>To this ſeruile feare ſucceedeth a third Feare, to wit initial, when a man begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to doe good for the loue of God, which he did before for the feare ef hell. Of this initial feare the Prophet Dauid ſaith in the Pſalme: * The feare of our Lord is the beginning of wiſdome. Pſal. 110. Initial feare is whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beginneth to loue God, whome before he feared; and by this meanes ſeruile feare is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the heart.</p>
               <p>To this initial feare ſucceedeth a fourth feare, called chaſt; by which we feare leaſt our bridegroome (to wit Chriſt Ieſus) delay, or depart from vs: leaſt we affro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, or offend him, &amp; leaſt we looſe him. This chaſt feare proceedeth from loue. This chaſt feare ariſeth from loue. Of this feare we read in the pſalm: * The feare of our Lord is holy, perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:14161:27"/> for euer and euer. (Pſal. 18.) Feare firſt commeth into the heart of man. And whie? That it may prepare a place for charitie. &amp; by how much the more that charitie doth begin to dwell in the heart of man, by ſo much the more feare doth decreaſe: by how much the more cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie is in the heart of man, by ſo much the leſſe feare is Whie. Becauſe charitie chaſeth it forth.</p>
               <p>Liſten deare ſiſter, and I will tell you a fit ſimilitude. Oftentimes we ſee that the thread is introduced by meanes of the briſtle or bigge rough haire: when any thing is ſowen, firſt the briſtle en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth in, and after the briſtle entreth the thread: ſo feare e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>treth firſt into the mind of man, and after feare charitie: feare en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth in that it may bring in charitie: but after that charitie is entred, it driueth forth feare. This feare is holy, for that it begetteth holines in the mind of a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:14161:28"/> This feare is holie, for that it bringeth perfect charitie into the mind of a man. For perfect charitie is perfect ſanctitie. This feare is chaſt, for that is doth not admit adulterous loue; and this, becauſe it loueth God aboue all things, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth nothing before his loue. This feare likewiſe is termed filial, for that it doth not feare God as a ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t feareth a cruel maiſter, but as a ſonne feareth a moſt louing father. This Feare is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore termed filial, for that it doth not feare as a ſeruant, but as a ſonne.</p>
               <p>But whence is it, that the Prophet Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid ſaieth. * The feare of our Lord is holy, permanent for euer and euer. (Pſal. 18.) ſithe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce S. Iohn ſaieth Perfect charitie caſteth forth feare (1. Io. c. 4.) This is that which we ſaid before, that he hath a chaſt and holy feare, who doth not feare, God for feare of hel, or for fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>are of torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, but for loue &amp; reuerence.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:14161:28"/> And this feare (to wit, the reuerence of God) remaineth for euer and euer. But he that feareth God for feare of the paines of hell, hath not a chaſt but a ſeruile feare in himſelfe, for that he hath not perfect charitie. For if he did perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loue God, he would haue perfect iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice in himſelfe, and would feare God, not for feare of torme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>s, but with feare and reuerence. And therefore feare of paine or torments is not in charitie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe perfect charitie chaseth it forth. The ſeruant feareth his maiſter in one ſort, and the ſonne his father in an other. The ſeruant feareth his maiſter with deſpaire and hatred: the ſonne feareth his father with reuerence and loue.</p>
               <p>Now therefore moſt reuerend ſiſter, I admoniſh you, that you feare God with loue &amp; reuerence. For I would not haue you lie alwayes groaning vnder the yoke of feare; but rather that you ſhould
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:14161:29"/> lift vp yourſelfe by loue to our lord your father, who hath made you as his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Moreouer I admoniſh you, that you loue God chaſtely, and preferre nothing before his loue: but that you deſpiſe for his loue all wordly things whatſoeuer. Againe I aduiſe you, and entreat you (moſt honeſt. Virgin) that you amend your life with all care and diligence: and therfore let your diſcourſe be chaſt, your gate honeſt, your countenance humble, your tongue affable, your mind full of loue, your hands full of good workes, and this by the aſſiſtance of our Lord, without whome you can doe nothing that is good. Moſt louing ſiſter in Chriſt if you will heare me as a brother, and feare God with your whole heart and affection, you ſhall haue many good things not onely in this life, but alſo in the life to come. Amen.</p>

               <p>* THE King hath brought me into the wine cellar, and hath ordered in me charirie. (Cant. 2.) This wine cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar is the church, in which is the wine of Euangelicall preaching. Into this cellar therefore the ſpouſe of the bridegroome (to wit a holy ſoule) is brought &amp; charitie is ordered in her: becauſe all things are not to be loued alike but a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ter a differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t manner. We ought not to loue all things equally, but ſome leſſe &amp; ſome more. For to know what to doe &amp; yet not to know what order we are to keepe in our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, is not perfect knowledge. If we do not loue thoſe things which we ought to loue: or if we loue thoſe things which we ought not to loue, we haue not cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:14161:30"/> And if we loue thoſe things more which we ought to loue leſſe: or if we loue thoſe things leſſe, which we ought to loue more, our charitie is not ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</p>
               <p>This therefore is ordinate charitie, that we loue God before all things, &amp; aboue all things. We ought to loue God with our whole heart, that is with our whole vnderſtanding, and with our whole ſoule, and with our whole will, and with our whole mind, and with our whole memorie: to the end that we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect all our vnderſtanding, and all our thoughts, and all our life to him from whome we haue all good things: or let nor part of our life be left idle, but let euerie thing that commeth into our mind be directed to that ſtreame, where the force of loue doth runne. Therefore moſt deare ſiſter, it is a thing moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and moſt neceſſarie for vs, that we loue God (who is the ſupreme good in

Doubtleſſe the loue of God is ſaid to be as ſtrong as death, becauſe like as death doth violently ſeparate the ſoule from the bodie: ſo the loue of God doth vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently ſeparate a man from the world, and from the loue of all things tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie. Verily the loue of God is as ſtrong as death: becauſe when we are morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the loue of God fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſinne &amp; vice: that which death doth doe in the bodily ſenſes, the ſame doth the loue of God effect in worldly deſires:</p>

In the firſt place God is loued (as is alreadie ſaid) in all things, and aboue all things. In the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d place our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is loued in God, that is, in good. Charitie hath two commaundements, the one pertaining to the loue of God, which is the greateſt commaundement: The other pertaining to the loue of our neighbour, which is like vnto this: according as is written: * Thou ſhalt loue the lord thy God with thy whole heart, &amp; thy whole ſoule, &amp; with all thy ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth &amp; with all thy mi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: &amp; thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as thy ſelfe. (Luc. 10.) As if he ſhould ſay: Thou oughtſt to loue thy neighbour to the ſame end as thou lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt thy ſelfe; to wit, that he may be good and vertuous, and may be able
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:14161:31"/> to attaine to eternal happines. Of this loue of God and our neighbour, the bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>degroome, (to wit, Chriſt Ieſus) ſpeaketh in the Canticles to his ſpouſe, that is to ſay, to the Church, or to a deuout ſoule, ſaying: * How beautifull are thy breaſts, my ſiſter ſpouſe: thy breaſts are more beautifull then wine, and the odour of thine ointments aboue all aromatical ſpices (Cant. 4.) What is vnderſtood by breaſts more fitly in this place, then the loue of God and our neighbour: of which we haue ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before? by which breaſts a deuout mind doth by her loue no wriſh all her ſenſes, is linked to her God by a moſt intimate affection, and affordeth to her neighboures all the good ſhee can.

Let vs therefore loue one an other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe charitie is from God. And he that loueth his brother is borne of God, and ſeeth God. He that loueth his brother, whome he ſeeth with the eies of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, ſeeth with the eies of his mind God remaining in himſelfe, to wit, charitie; becauſe God is charitie. And he that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not his brother, whome he ſeeth with the eies of his bodie, ſeeth not with the eies of his mind God remaining in himſelfe, to wit charitie: becauſe if there were charitie in him, God were in him, becauſe God is charitie.</p>
               <p>We ought likewiſe to loue our kins

Howbeit we are not bound to doe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of mercie to all men in the ſame meaſure; but to ſome leſſe, and to others more. Dearely beloued ſiſter, if we wil

               <p>Moreouer we ought for Gods ſake to loue our enemies, like as he himſelfe ſaieth in the Goſpel: * loue your enemies, doe good to them that hate you and pray for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that perſecute &amp; abuſe you: that you may be the children of your father, which is in heauen. (Mat. 5.) Thus then you ſee (venerable ſiſter) the neceſſitie of charitie, without which no man is able to pleaſe God almightie. He loueth not God, that hateth man. Neither doth he loue God, that contemneth his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements. Charitie is the roote of all vertues. For without charitie what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer we doe, doth nothing at all auaile vs. Our ſtudie and labour is to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, if we haue not charitie; becauſe God is charitie.

               <p>Euerie new conuerſion hath ſome thing of the old man remaining. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore no vertue ought to be done o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly in the ſight of men, vntill the old conuerſation be wholy rooted out of the mind. Euerie one doth then feele him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe moſt troubled and tempted, when he commeth firſt to the ſeruice of God. So the people of Iſrael were oppreſſed by the Egyptians with a more heauie burden, when the knowledge of God was by Moyſes manifeſted vnto them. (Exod. 1. &amp; 2.) For vices haue peace in a man before his conuerſion: but when they are expelled, they ariſe more grei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly againſt him. Many after their conuerſion are troubled with vnchaſt motions: which notwithſtanding they endure not to their damnation, but to their trial and probation: to wit, that they may alwayes haue an enemie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt to keepe them doing, yet ſo as that

               <p>Aremiſſe or ſlack conuerſion doth bring many into their former errours, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue them into their wonted neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.

Slouthfulnes and fraud are to be feared in euerie worke of God. We doe God wrong, when we praiſe not God, but our ſelues by the good deede which we haue done. We commit ſlouthfulnes, when we doe thoſe things careleſly which belong to Gods ſeruice. Euerie worldly art or Science hath quick and nimble artiſans, and ſuch as practice the ſame with diligence. Why? What is the reaſon? Becauſe they haue the reward of their worke preſent

               <p>Thoſe that are newly conuerted to God, ought not to be employed in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal cares of the world. For if they be entangled with them: they preſently (as young trees newly planted, and not hauing as yet taken roote) are ſhaken to and fro, and begin to wither: neither is mutatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge of place alwayes good for the ſoules of thoſe that are newly conuerted. Howbeit it hapneth often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to ſome, that the place of their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode being changed, the affection of their mind is likewiſe altered. For it is conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that euerie one ſhould depart euen corporally from that place, where he reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>breth that he hath beene ſubiect to vice.</p>

Many come to the Monaſterie, not ſo much for the ſaluation of their ſoule, as for the neceſſitie of their bodie, who worſhip not God, but their bellie; of whome the Apoſtle doth ſay: * Whoſe God is their bellie. (Phillip. 3.) Their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention is not, that they may ſyncerely ſerue God, but that they may eate and drinke their fill, and be well clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed, and that it may goe well with them in this world. And for that they loue things tranſitorie and earthly, they looſe thoſe that are heauenly. And according to the ſaying of our Lord: * The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue their reward in this world. (Mat. 6.) Wherefore deare ſiſter, we muſt be

No man deſireth to be clothed in rich garments, but when he may be ſeene by others. It is euident then, that he ſeeketh gay clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for vaine glorie.</p>
               <p>Venerable ſiſter, by this we may know that we loue the world, if we loue to be
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:14161:49"/> well apparailed. He that loueth not the world, careth not how he is clothed. When a man reioyceth at his corporall beautie or feature, his mind departeth from the loue of his Creator. By how much the more we reioyce at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines of our bodie, by ſo much the more we are ſeparated from the loue of God almightie. By how much the more we take content in things earthly and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, by ſo much the leſſe we deſire thoſe that are heauenly and eternal. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily a religious woeman deſerueth to be reprehended, if ſhee loue to be trimmely attired. The ſpouſe of Chriſt is not without blame, if ſhee affect fine clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing The handmaid of Chriſt, that hath perfectly forſaken the world, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to be poorely apparailed. The hand maid of Chriſt that deſireth fine array, hath not as yet deſpiſed the world per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly. A black garment doth inſinuat

               <p>Now therefore moſt reuerend ſiſter, I admoniſh you, that you be ſuch in deede, as you are in weede. I deſire you, that you will adorne the habit of our holy order, by your good behauiour. Your habit is holy, let your heart be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: as your garments are holy, ſo let your woorkes be holy, and as your veile is hallowed, ſo let euerie thing that you take in hand. Be not one thing within, and an other without. Be not one thing in priuate, and an other in publick: as you deſire to be eſteemed, ſo be indeede; as you are in face, ſo be in fact, as you are in countenance, ſo be in your actions. Amen.</p>

               <p>COmpunction of heart is humilitie of mind, proceeding from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of ſinne, and the feare of iudgement. That compunction is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, which doth repell from it ſelfe all delight of carnal things, and fixeth the intention of the mind in the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God with all care and diligence. We finde compunction to be two-fold. The one, by which the ſoule of euerie ſeruant of God is afflicted for the loue of God, that is, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhee calleth to mind the euills which ſhee hath committed.
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:14161:50"/> The other, when ſhee is ſorrowfull and ſadde, through the deſire of eternal bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. The mind of a iuſt man is moued to compunction by fower meanes, to wit, through the memorie of her ſinnes, through the remembrance of the future paines, through the conſideration of this preſent pilgrimage, and laſtly through the deſire of the happines of heauen, to wit, that ſhee may ſpeedily attaine vnto the ſame.

The heart of wiſemen is where there is ſpiritual ſadnes, and the heart of fooles, where there is ſecular mirth. They that are ſorrowfull according to God, are wiſe: contrarily thoſe that are ſorrowfull according to the world, are fooles. Wherevpon our Lord ſaieth in the Goſpell: * Reioyce in this, that your names are written in heauen. (Luc. 10.) And the Apoſtle S. Paul. * As ſorrowfull, but alwayes reioycing. (2. Cor. 6.) And againe: * Reioyce in our Lord alwayes: againe I ſay reioyce: (Phillip. 4) ſpiritual

But of ſecular ſadnes Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſaieth: * Sorow hath killed many, and there is no profit in it. (Eccli. 30.) Againe of ſpiritual ioy it is ſaid: * Let the heart of them reioyce, that ſeeke our Lord. (Pſal. 104.) And againe of worldly mirth it is ſaid; * Woe be to you, that now do laugh, becauſe you ſhall mourne and weepe. (Luc. 6.) Moſt deare ſiſter, heare likewiſe what S. Paul ſaieth: * The ſorrow that is according to God, worketh penance vnto ſaluation, that is ſtable: but the ſorrow of the world worketh death. (2. Cor. 7.) The prayer of a man that is alwayes ſad doth no good, neither can it aſcend vnto God. Where ſadnes doth oppoſe it ſelfe to the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:14161:58"/> holy Ghoſt as an obſtacle, there prayer is not acceptable: becauſe it is weake, and cannot aſcend to God.</p>
               <p>Wherefore louing ſiſter, caſt aſide ſadnes, ceaſe to be melancholy; expell ſadnes and ſorow from you. Be not addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to too much ſadnes, perſeuere not in penſiuenes; neither let your heart be the harbour or habitation of heauines. Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes is one of the ſeuen deady ſimes, and therefore to be eschewed by all Gods ſeruants. Wherevpon S.

By how much the more a man loueth God, by ſo much the more he ſhall be bleſſed. Loue is the ſpeciall and proper vertue of the Saincts. My moſt louing ſiſter in Chriſt, I haue ſaid this, that no loue of the world may ſeparate you from the loue of Chriſt.

(Cant. 4.) Let the left hand of my bridegroome (Chriſt Ieſus) be vnder my head, that is to ſay: let the guift of the holy Ghoſt, during this preſent life, reſt in me: and let the vnderſtanding of the holy ſcriptures be in my mind, that I may know him, and perfectly loue him: (Cant. 2.) that is to ſay, make me to attaine to eternal felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>

* Walke in loue as Chriſt alſo loued vs, &amp; deliuered himſelfe for vs. (Ephes. 5.) Likewiſe the Apoſtle S. Iohn ſaieth: * He that loueth his brother abideth in the light, and ſcandal is not in him. But he that hateth his brother is in the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and walke h in the darknes, and knoweth not whiter he goeth, becauſe the darknes hath bli<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded his eies. (1. Io. 2.) If any one ſhall ſay, that I loue God, and hateth his brother he is a lier. For he that loueth not his brother whome he ſeeth: God whome he ſeeth not can he loue? And this commendement we haue from God that he which loueth God, loue alſo his brother (1. Io. 4.) Salomon alſo ſaith? * He loueth at all times that is a freind, and a brother is proued in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes. (Pro. 17.) S. Auguſtine likewiſe ſaieth thus: You conquer a man by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane felicitie; you conquer the diuel by the loue of your enemie.</p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:14161:64"/>
               <p>Howbeit, deare ſiſter, the loue of Gods ſeruants one towards another ought not to be carnal, but ſpiritual. Nothing is more gratefull to God then fraternal loue and affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nothing more delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the diuel then diſcord and diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Holy loue is free from ſcandal. Eſteeme euerie faithfull man to be your brother. Remember that one ſupreme work-man hath made vs. True loue is void of ſcandal and bitternes. Venerable ſiſter, in the loue of your neighbour you ſhall know how you ought to attaine to the loue of God. Like as loue doth lift vp the mind, ſo malice doth caſt it downe. You can neither loue God truly without your neighbour, nor your neigh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bour without God. Then you haue true charitie indeede, when you loue your freind in God, and your foe for God. The more liberal you are in louing your neighbour, the more ample ſhall your
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:14161:64"/> reward be heereafter. If you loue your neighbour truly, your heart will be in reſt and tranquilitie. But he that bateth his neighbour is enuelopped in darknes: and therefore by louing your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, you cleanſe the eie of your mind to ſee God the better. Howbeit moſt R. ſiſter, I admoniſh you, that you loue no man carnally. Wherevpon S. Iſidorus ſaith: He ſheweth himſelfe to be earthly minded, that loueth any mortal man car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, more then is expedient.</p>
               <p>We cannot abide in God, if we will not liue at concord in this world: a true friend is tried in time of neede. If we will keepe Gods commandements, we muſt loue our neighboures as our ſelues: becauſe he that ſincerely loueth his brother, doth ſoone appeaſe God the father. He that loueth his neighbour, cannot commit murther, nor aculterie, nor theft, nor periurie, nor beare falſe
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:14161:65"/> witnes, nor take any thing by force, not beare any one ill will, nor liue at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Wherefore honeſt virgin, let vs alwayes meditate and practice the loue of God and our neighbour, in which the whole law doth depend and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Moreouer if our neighbour ſuffer any tribulation, or ſicknes, or loſſe, or is caſt into priſon, it is a token that we are in the bodie of the Church, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dole for him: but if we condole not, we are alreadie cut off from the bodie of the Church. Charitie, which doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binde and quicken all the members of the Church, if it ſee vs to reioyce at our neighbours miſerie, doth immediatly cut vs off from the bodie. So long a member grieueth, as it remaineth in the bodie. But if it be cut off from the bodie, it can neither feele, nor grieue. If a hand, or a foote, or ſome other member be cut off
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:14161:65"/> from the bodie, if the whole bodie ſhould afterwards be deuided in many parts, or caſt into the fire; that hand, or foote, or other member would then feele no paine, for that it is alreadie ſeparated from the bodie. Such is the caſe of euerie Chriſtian, which doth not grieue at an other mans loſſe, tribulation, neceſſitie, or anguiſh; but (which is worſe) doth reioyce, becauſe he is alreadie deuided from the bodie of the Church. But let vs (honeſt virgin) loue well and ſincerely, if we deſire to keepe true and perfect charitie. Let vs endeauour to loue all good Chriſtians as our ſelues, that Chriſt being out head, we may merit to be his members: that when Chriſt our life ſhall appeare, we may appeare with him in glorie, by the concord of charitie, and the loue of God, and our neighbour.</p>

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:14161:68"/> 14.) Keepe loyaltie with your neighbour in his pouertie, that you may alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce with him in his proſperitie. Remaine faithfull to your neighbour in time of diſtreſſe, that you may be coheire with him in his inheritance. He that diggeth a pit for his neighbour, ſhall fall into it: and he that prepareth a ſnare for his neighbour, ſhall periſh in it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon the Pſalmiſt ſaieth: * He hath opened a pit, and digged it vp: and he is fallen into the ditch, which he made. (Pſal. 7.) He loueth not his neighbour perfectly, that ſuccourreth him not in time of aduerſitie. By how much the more we compaſſionately aſſiſt our neighbour, by ſo much the more we approach to our Creator. We ought to care for our ſelues in that manner, as that we neglect not the care of our neighbour.</p>
               <p>Therefore deare ſiſter, whatſoeuer

That which you would not willingly endure, doe not to an other, leaſt the like happen to you. Be as fauourable in other mens offences, as in your owne: and conſider not your ſelfe and others, after a different faſhion.</p>
               <p>If your enemie fall, do not reioyce or grow proud at his ruine: neither take

                  </gap>h propoſed the vertues of the Saincts for our example and inſtruction: that by following their foote-ſtep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> we may attaine to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen: or if we will not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low or imitate them in well doing, we may be inexcuſable in paine.</p>
               <p>The Saincts of God, aſlong as they liued in this world, ceaſed not to be fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent in good workes: to wit, in faſting, in watching, in almes deedes, in chaſtitie in continencie, in long an imitie, in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, in ſweetnes, in prayers, in perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, in beneuolence, in hunger and thirſt, in cold and nakednes, and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny labours for the loue of Chriſt. The
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:14161:72"/> Saincts of God deſpiſed this preſent world, that they might obtaine that kingdome which ſhall endure world without end: they receiued not heere the promiſes, or earthly and tranſitorie ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which lead ſuch as abuſe them to eternal perdition: but abandoning this countrie with their whole intention, they lifted vp their eies to the heauenly Hieruſalem.</p>
               <p>The Saincts of God eſchewed ſinne in thought, word, and deede, in their ſight, in their hearing, in their nod or beck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; in their eies, in their hands, and in their feete: in chiding, brawling, and diſſention: in vaine glorie, pride, and boaſting: in couetouſnes, in gluttonie, in drowſines, in fornication, and in drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennes. Preſeruing their bodies and ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, they faſted two manner of wayes, to wit, from vice, and ſinfull actions. Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence from meate is good, but abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:14161:72"/> from vice is much better. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon the Church ſaith of her mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, that is of the aforſaid holy Fathers: * My hands hane diſtilled myrrhe. (Cant. 5.) What do we vnderſtand by the hands, but the actions of the Saincts? and what is ment by myrrhe, but the mortification of the fleſh, and of vices? The hands of the Church are holy men doing good workes, of whome ſhee ſaith: * They haue wrought iuſtice. (Heb. 11.) The ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of the Church there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do diſtill the myrrhe of good workes becauſe they ſhew vnto vs the examples of vertuous actions, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare vnto vs how we ought to morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the vices of our fleſh. Wherevpon one of them ſaid: * If you liue accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fleſh, you ſhall die. (Rom. 8.) And againe: * Mortifie your members, that are vpon the earth. (Coloſ. 3.) And againe the Church ſaith: * My fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:14161:73"/> are full of moſt approued myrrhe. (Cant. 5.) Then verily our myrrhe is moſt approued, when our fleſh is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly mortified, and our vices and ſinnes are vtterly extinguiſhed.</p>
               <p>Wherefore beloued ſiſter in Chriſt, if we deſire to obtaine the company of the Saincts, it is neceſſarie that we follow their examples. If we ſinne and doe amiſſe, we haue now no excuſe. Why? For that the law of God doth admoniſh vs daily, that we liue vertuouſly: and the examples of the holy Fathers do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually inuite vs to doe good workes. And if now and then we follow the example of wickedmen and ſinners, why do we not follow the examples of the holy Fathers? And if we are apt to imitate the wicked in wickednes, why are we ſlow to imitate the good in goodnes? Wherefore, venerable ſiſter, let vs be ſeech God, that thoſe vertues,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:14161:73"/> which he hath prepared for his Saincts for their crowne, may not turne to our torment and damnation, but to our greater good and ſaluation. Doubtleſſe we beleeue, that if we follow the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of holy men, we ſhall after this life raigne with them in heauen.</p>
               <p>The more we read the liues of the holy Fathers, the more blame worthy we are, if we refuſe to follow their exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples. Now ô vertuous virgin, I beſeech al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, that he will beſtow vpon you thoſe vertues of the holy Fathers: to wit the humilitie of Chriſt, the deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Peter, the charitie of Iohn, the obedience of Abraham, the patience of Iſaac, the long ſufferance of Iacob, the chaſtitie of Ioſeph, the meeknes of Moyſes, the conſtancie of Ioſuè, the benignitie of Samuel, the mercie of Dauid, the abſtinence o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Daniel, and the other worthy workes of the ancient
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:14161:74"/> Saincts, that after this mortal life, you may be able to attaine to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie.</p>
               <p>Conſider daily, ô virgin of Chriſt, with what moderation, with what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, or with what compunction theſe holy me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue pleaſed God. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon in the perſon of Chriſt in the Canticles of canticles it is ſaid to the Church: * How beautifull are thy paces in ſhooes, ô Princes daughter. (Cant. 7.) Chriſt by the power of his god-head is Prince of all things created: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the holy Church is called the daughter of the Prince, becauſe by the pteaching of Chriſt ſhee is regenerated into a new life. Now what are the ſhooes of the Church, but the examples of the holy Fathers, by which we are fenced in the way of this world, that with theſe ſhooes we may paſſe through all tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. We (deare ſiſter in Chriſt) do
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:14161:74"/> likewiſe ſpiritually fence our feete with ſhooes, when we take example of well liuing from the holy Fathers; that like them we may vanguiſh worldly tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Againe in the ſame Canticles the bridegroome of the Church Chriſt Ieſus ſpeaketh, ſaying: * I came downe into the garden of Nutts, to ſee the fruits of the vales, and to looke if the vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards had flowriſhed, and the Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granats budded. (Cant. 6.) The vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards flowriſh, when in the Church children are newly generated in the faith, and are prepared to a holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation, as it were to the ſoliditie of good workes. The Pomegranats do budde, when perfect men by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of their good workes do edifie their neighboures, and in newnes of holy conuerſation do renew them by their preaching, and vertuous examples. Wherefore I admoniſh you, ſpiritual
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:14161:75"/> friend in Chriſt, that in your whole life and conuerſation, you giue good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to all men.</p>
               <p>Venerable ſiſter, I deſire, that by liuing vertuouſly, you ſhine to all the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maides of God, that are with you in the Monaſterie: becauſe as S.

Wherevpon our Lord ſaith: * Let your light ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee your good workes, and glorifie your father, which is in heauen: (Mat. 5.) for that all glorie is to be giuen to God alone. Howbeit I admoniſh you, ô virgin of Chriſt, that your actions be ſo done in publick

And Salomon ſaith: * Among the proud there are alwayes brawles. (Prou. 13.) * An euill ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alwayes ſeeketh brawles, an euill Angell is ſent aganiſt him (Pro 17.) He that walketh by dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous places, quickly falleth: ſo he that daily contendeth with his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boures, quickly falleth into ſcandal. Meeke men do alwayes deteſt conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they that daily contend and brawle are loued but of a few. Peace and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord

               <p>Moſt deare ſiſter, heare S. Auguſtine, ſaying: O how irreprehenſible might we be in our life and conuerſation, if we were ſo carefull to amend our owne imperfections, as we are to carpe at thoſe of other men. Howbeit if we well conſider our ſelues, we ſhall find many things amiſſe. This I would haue you know, that there is nothi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g more vnſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then contentions among religious men, who by concord and loue ought to ſhine in the world, like the ſtarres in heauen. Contentions are wont to haue their original and of ſpring from enuie and detraction. But if detraction and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates be in the Cloiſter: where is regular taciturnitie, were is the ſanctitie of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, where is the ſilence of the order, where is the good obſeruance of the monaſterie, where is the bond of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,

               <p>If they which ought to liue in peace, begin to contend, brawle, and detract one an other, where is that ſweete life, that quiet life, that peaceable life, that modeſt life, that chaſt life, that contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>platiue life, that Angelical life, that ougt to be in a clayſter?

               <p>But if perchance you do not beleeue me, heare the Apoſtle S. Iamès, Saying: * If any man thinke himſelfe to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, not brideling his tongue, but ſeducing his heart: this mans religion is vaine. (Iam. 1.) the tongue is a little member in the bodie of man: howbeit if it be not gouerned warily, it defileth and corrupteth the whole bodie. For like as a little leauen corrupteth the whole paſte, and as a ſmal ſparkle of fire burneth a great foreſt: ſo the tongue (if it be not brideled) doth ſcandalize lords
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:14161:78"/> and gouernours, equalls and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, ſubiects and ſuch as are infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, and doth ſet them at ſtrife and variance. A contentious tongue, if it be not curbed, permitteth no man to liue in quiet. A ſcolding tongue is full of poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: it it be not rebuked when it ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth amiſſe; it moueth all the ſtanders by to offence.</p>
               <p>Wherefore venerable ſiſter, I giue you this counſel, * that you ſtay your tongue from euill and your lipps, that they ſpeake no guile. (Pſal. 33.) Conſider from whence you haue come, and for what end. You haue left the world, and fled to the tents of God, that is, to a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſterie: you haue forſaken the riches of the world, and haue come to gaine the riches of heauen, and for this cauſe haue choſen pouertie. You haue choſen pouertie of your owne accord, and the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore ought to forget all things, which
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:14161:78"/> you haue left for the loue of God. Haue a care therefore not to preferre your ſelfe before others: the greater you are, humble your ſelfe in all things: auoid the conuenticle of conſpiracie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: fliè murmuring and whiſpering, and do not hearken to the ſame.

(Pro 1.). Hold diſcipline, leaue it not: Keepe it becauſe the ſame is thy life. He that hateth reprehenſions is vnwiſe.

But he that will not keepe diſcipline, ſhall find death. Pouertie and ignominie to him that forſaketh diſcipline: but he that yeeldeth to him, that rebuketh, ſhall be glorified. A foole

               <p>A wiſe and diſcreete man wil not mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure againſt him, that chaſtiſeth him. Howbeit chaſtiſement muſt be mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. Wherevpon S. Ambroſe ſaith: He that is gently chaſtiſed doth reuerence him that chaſtiſeth him: but he that is chaſtiſed or rebuked ouer ſeuerely, doth neither take it in good part, neither is he amended thereby. They are ſweetly to be tolerated, who by reaſon of their weaknes cannot be rebuked. According to the diuerſitie of thoſe that offend, ſome are to be endured, others to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, for that there are ſondrie ſortes of ſinnes.</p>
               <p>The Prelates of the Church ought to

What other thing do the braſen pillars ſignifie in the temple, but the Prelates in the Church? Whoſoeuer do vndertake the ſolicitude of gouerment, do as pillars beare the burden that is laid vpon it. Cherubi ſignifieth fulnes of knowledge. The Cherubins therefore are placed vpon the braſen pillars; becauſe the Prelates of the Church ought to be full of heauenly knowledge. By the lion is ſignified the terrour of ſeueritie: and by the oxe the patience of leuitie or mercie. On the pillars therefore the lions ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:14161:84"/> their ſubiects ſometimes by ſeueritie ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by ſweetnes: ſometimes by wordes at other times by blowes: becauſe he that will not amend by faire meanes, muſt of neceſſitie be corrected and rebuked by force. For thoſe woundes muſt be cut off by abſciſſion, which cannot be cured by any milder meanes.</p>
               <p>He that being ſecretly admoniſhed of his fault doth neglect to amend, muſt openly be rebuked: to the end that the wound, that cannot be cured in priuate, may be amended in publique. They that openly offend, ought openly to be rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked: that whiles they are healed by open reprehenſion, they likewiſe may be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, that did amiſſe by imitating them: that whiles one is corrected, the reſt may be amended.

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:14161:84"/> likewiſe ſaith: There are many that liſten when they are blamed, but yet diſdaine to returne to amendment. Let euerie one heare of the kingdome of heauen what he affecteth: let him heare of hell what he feareth: that if loue do not enuite him to vertue: feare at leaſt may reuoke him therevnto. S.

Wherevpon the Church or euerie faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſoule ſaith of Prelates or ſuperiours in the Canticles: * The keepers that goe about the citie found me: they

By the keepers of the citie we vnderſtand Prelates, who keepe the ſtate of the holy Church, who likewiſe find a faithfull ſoule, and ſtrike the ſame by their preachings, exhortations, and threatnings, and wound her with the loue of Chriſts charitie: neither doth this ſuffice them, but they alſo take away her cloke from her; that is, all temporal ſub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Wherefore deate ſiſter in Chriſt, it is verie fitting that we loue our Prelates, as our parents; to the end that we may willingly receiue from them the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of our ſaluation, according to the counſel of King Dauid, ſaying * Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend diſcipline, leaſt ſometime our Lord

Our Sauiour Chriſt is the true Salomon, for that he is truly peaceable, becauſe he hath made peace betweene God and man. The little bed of Salomon is the congregation of the faithfull, in which God doth dwell and repoſe. Three-ſcore valiants compaſſe the little bed of Salomon, to wit, Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes or ſuperiours; who by defending, chaſtiſing, rebuking, correcting, and admoniſhing, do enuiron and keepe the Church of God from enimies viſible and inuiſible. Who in this reſpect are called valiant; for that the Prelates of the Church ought to be perfect in the obſeruance of Gods commaundements: all holding ſwordes, that is, the ſpiritual worde, for that by their preaching they ought to repreſſe the vices of their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects.

Euerie mans ſworde vpon his thigh. The Prelates of our holy mother the Church hold their ſwordes vpon their thigh, for that they ought firſt to cut off vice in themſelues, and then in their ſubiects. And all this they doe in reſpect of feares by night, that is, in reſpect of the ſecret ſnares of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſpirits: who during the night of this world, do eſpecially lie in waite to entrap holy Prelates, that they being deceiued, they may foule and defile King Salomons bed, that is, the congregation of the ſeruants of God.</p>
               <p>Moſt deare ſiſter, I haue told you this for this cauſe, that you may know, how humbly and deuoutly we ought to obey our Prelates or Superiours. Obedience alone is the vertue, which doth engraffe
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:14161:91"/> other vertues into our mind, and doth keepe them being engraffed; whereof Salomon ſaith: Obedience is better then victimes: becauſe by victimes the fleſh of an other is killed, but by obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience our owne will is bound and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed. Wherevpon it is truly ſaid, that * an obedient man ſpeaketh victories: (Prou. 21.) becauſe he that for the loue of God humbly obeyeth an other mans voyce, doth in his heart conquer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Adam fell into hell, for that he was diſobedient: but Chriſt aſcended into heauen, becauſe he obeyed God the Father euen vnto death. Like as by the diſobedience of Adam many became ſinners: ſo by the obedience of Chriſt many became righteous. And as by the ſinne of Adam all men are condemned to death: ſo by the iuſtice of Chriſt all men are iuſtified vnto life. And againe: As the diſobedience of our firſt parents
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:14161:92"/> begot death: ſo the obedience of Chriſt begot life.</p>
               <p>Therefore deare ſiſter, if for the loue of Chriſt you will be obedient to your Prelates and ſuperiours, you ſhall raigne with Chriſt in eternal happines. Haue a care at no time to ſpeake amiſſe of your mother, that is, of your Abbeſſe or Prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſe. Neuer ſhew yourſelfe rebellious to your Prelates, contradict your ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours in no caſe. Contrariwiſe comport your ſelfe with reuerence towards all that are of better knowledge, and better life then your ſelfe. Reuerence euerie man according to the merit of his ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitie. Giue greater reuerence to thoſe of greater degree. Honour euerie man according to his dignitie. Behaue not your ſelfe towards your ſuperiours, as if you were their equal: obey your Seniors, and humbly accompliſh their will. Yeild to the authoritie of your

               <p>O ſpouſe of Chriſt, obey men in that manner, as that you offend not your Creatour. Neuer be obedient in things that are euill.

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:14161:93"/> his end. For euerie one at the day of his death ſhall be iuſtified, or condemned.

                  </gap>m. For which cauſe it is likewiſe ſaid in the Canticles: * In my little bed in the nights I haue ſought him, whome my ſoule loueth. (Cant. 3.)</p>
               <p>Wherefore I admoniſh you, honeſt virgin, that you ſeeke the ſame Ieſus Chriſt you bridegroome in your bed: I meane in reſt of mind, and quietnes of contemplation. In the nights ſeeke him, that is, in this life ſigh after him, and deſire him: that you may perfectly find him heereafter, and ſee him raigning in the glorie of his Father. Seeke him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:14161:94"/> intermiſſion by liuing vertuouſly, that you may merit to ſee him in eternal felicitie. I deſire you ô ſpouſe of Chriſt, that you will ſay with the Prophet Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid: * My ſoule hath thirſted after the ſtrong liuing: when ſhall I come, and appeare before the face of God. (Pſal. 41) Verily your ſoule doth thirſt after God, if ſhee loue him aboue all things. Verily your ſoule doth thirſt after God, if for his ſake ſhee deſpiſe all earthly things. Verily your ſoule doth thirſt after God, if ſhee couet to ſee him raygning in ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial happines. The ſame Prophet doth likewiſe admoniſh vs, ſaying: * Seeke ye our Lord and be confirmed: ſeeke his face alwayes: (Pſal. 104.) that is, in proſperitie and aduerſitie, in pouertie, and plentie, in ſicknes and in health, in youth and in old age.</p>
               <p>We ought to ſeeke God with our whole mind, and intention that we may
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:14161:94"/> deſerue from him to be confirmed in holy conuerſation, and may merit to find and ſee him in his heauenly king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Let vs cleanſe our ſelues from all impuritie of fleſh and ſpirit; becauſe none ſhall be able to be eleuated to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen at the day of doome, but thoſe that are chaſt of bodie, neither ſhal any be able to ſee the glorie of Gods diuine maieſtie, but thoſe that are cleane of heart. Beleeue me (deare ſiſter) the kingdome of heauen will not be giuen to ſuch as are idle and gad vp &amp; downe, but to ſuch as ſeeke, aske, and knock for the ſame. For ſo our Lord ſaith: * Aske, and it ſhall be giuen to you: ſeeke, and you ſhall finde: knock, and it ſhall be opened to you. (Mat. 7.) The entrance therefore of the kingdome of heauen is to be asked by praying: it is to be ſought by liuing vertuouſly: it is to be knocked at by perſerering in the ſeruice
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:14161:95"/> of God almightie. It is not enough to begin good actions, but we muſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſtriue to perſeuere in them all the dayes of our life. * For it is better not to know the way of iuſtice, then after the knowledge to turne back. (2. Pet. 2.) Wherevpon our Lord ſaith in the Goſpel: * No man putting his hand to the plough, and looking back, is apt for the kingdome of God. (Luc. 9.)</p>
               <p>Therefore venerable ſiſter it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, that by the deſire of eternal beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude we knock daily at the eares of almightie God, and do not deſiſt from thoſe good workes which we haue begun, vntill he opening, we deſerue to be freed from the priſon of this morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, and attaine to the gate of our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly countrie. Amiable ſiſter in Chriſt, it is good to perſeuere in Gods ſeruice: becauſe they that leaue the Monaſterie, and returne to the world, become more
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:14161:95"/> black then coales. Why? Becauſe by tepiditie of mind they are dead and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed from the fire of the charitie of God. Wherevpon S. Iſidorus ſaith: They that through the deſire of the world, returne from a good life to a bad, are darkned, and through the blacknes of ſinne, defiled and obſcured, and eſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from the light of the brightnes of God. They that runne out of a Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to the world, are ſeparated from the ſocietie of Angells, and aſſociated to the diuells. They that leaue religion, and deſcend to a ſecular courſe of life; are ſeparated from the ſocietie of God, and made ſlaues vnder the dominion of the diuel.</p>
               <p>Moſt louing ſiſter in Chriſt, conſider what you haue done. Daily call to mind, from whence, to what, and wherefore you are come. You for Gods ſake haue forſaken and deſpiſed all things tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:14161:96"/> and for the loue of him haue made choiſe of a Monaſterie. You haue bought the kingdome of heauen, and giuen your ſelfe for the purchaſe of the ſame. Endeauour therefore with great care and ſolicitude, that you looſe not that kingdome, which you haue pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed: but ſtriue perpetually to poſſeſſe that, which you haue ſo much wiſhed and deſired. Haue a care, leaſt you looſe that kingdome of ineſtimable price, for which you haue giuen your ſelfe. Heare what the Apoſtle S. Paul doth ſay: * He that ſtriueth for the maiſterie, is not crowned, vnleſſe he ſtriue lawfully. He ſtriueth lawfully, that perſeuereth in the ſeruice of God witho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or hypocriſie. He ſerueth God in that manner as is fitting, who accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſheth that good worke which he hath begun. He employeth himſelfe in good workes like a good Chriſtian, who
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:14161:96"/> accompliſheth thoſe things, which he hath well begun. Wherevpon our holy mother the Church ſaith of her mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in the Canticles: * The beames of our houſes are of Cedar, our afters of cypreſſe trees. (Cant. 1.) The houſes of the Church are the aſſemblies of the faithfull ſeruing God, and perſeuering in thoſe things which appertaine to Gods ſeruice. The Cedar therefore and Cypreſſe are trees of an vncorruptible nature, and ſignifie Gods Saincts, who burne with an vnfailing and vnfading deſire of their Creatour, and perſeuere in good workes to the verie end of their liues.</p>
               <p>Wherefore venerable ſiſtet, be you alſo a cypreſſe tree in the houſe of God, and perſeuere in good life to the verie end. Be you likewiſe a Cedat in Gods houſe by giuing good examples, and the ſweet ſauour of a vertuous conuerſation to
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:14161:97"/> your companions, Prude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t virgin, I haue ſaid this in this regard, that with your whole mind you deſpiſe the loue of the world. I haue ſaid this in this reſpect, that you neuer forſake a religions life; and ſeeke after a recular. I haue ſaid this to this end, that you neuer deſire to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake your monaſterie, and (as a dogge returning to his vomit) to returne to worldly vanitie. I admoniſh you, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuere all the dayes of your life in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and neuer deſire to returne to the world againe. I adminiſh you to loue your monaſterie with your whole heart, and eſteeme the world as baſe in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of it. I admoniſh you to remaine all the dayes of your life in the houſe of God, a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d neuer to ſeeke to returne againe to the world? Why? Becauſe a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſticall life is addicted to contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a worldly life is labourſome and troubleſome; a monaſtical life is holy, a
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:14161:97"/> ſecular life is full of ſinne and iniquitie: a monaſtical life is ſpiritual, a recular life is carnal: a monaſtical life is heauenly, a ſecular life is earthly: a monaſtical life is free from earthly affaires, a ſecular life is full of troubles and cares: a mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical life is full of amitie and affection, a ſecular life is full of ſtrife and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: a monaſtical life is free from cares, a ſecular life is full of iarres: a monaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal life is peaceable and quiet, a ſecular life is full of diſcord and debate: a mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical life is chaſt and cleane, a ſecular life is vnchaſt and defiled with ſinne: a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtical life is vertuous, a ſecular life is vertuous: a monaſtical life is full of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, a ſecular life is full of vices: a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtical life is full of Sanctitie, a ſecular life is full of iniquitie.</p>
               <p>Reuerend ſiſter, you haue heard the commodities that are in a monaſterie, you haue heard the euills that are in the

But thoſe that are virgins in bodie, and not in mind, are not wiſe, but fooliſh: neither are they able to goe forth to meete the bridegroome, becauſe they haue not oyle in their veſſells, that is, they haue not chaſtitie in their mindes. So ſaith bleſſed Iſidorus: Shee that is a
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:14161:100"/> Virgin in bodie and not in mind, ſhall haue no reward at the day of iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. And our Lord in the Goſpel ſaith of fooliſh virgins: * Amen I ſay to you, I know you not. (Mat. 25.) For this cauſe I admoniſh you (deare ſiſter) that you be a virgin in mind and bodie, that after this life ended, you may deſerue to be placed by your heauenly bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome Chriſt Ieſus in the bed chamber of eternal beatitude.</p>
               <p>Virginitie is not commaunded, but counſelled, for that it is a thing ſo ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excellent. Virginitie is a double good, for that in this life it is void of ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and ſhall receiue the reward of chaſtitie in the next world.

(Iſay. 56.) All ſinne by penance receiueth pardon: but virginitie, if it be deſtained, can by no meanes be repaired: for albeit any one may by penance receiue pardon, yet he can neuer recouer his former incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</p>
               <p>Venerable ſiſter, virginitie of fleſh is worth nothing, where integritie of mind is wanting. Virgins glorying of their merits, are compared to hypocrites; who outwardly deſire the glorie of their good actions, which they ought to haue inwardly in their conſciences. For this is that which is ſaid in the Goſpel, * that the virgins had not oyle in their veſſells, (Mat. 25.) that is;
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:14161:102"/> did not reſerue the teſtimonie of their good workes in their conſciences: to wit, to glorie in the face in the ſight of men, not in the heart in the ſight of God. S. Auguſtine of ſuch virgins writeth thus: Virginitie of fleſh nothing hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth, where anger of mind inhabiteth. There is great difference betweene the puritie of a virginal ſoule polluted with no contagion of ſinne, and that ſoule, that hath beene ſubiect to the luſt of many men. Venerable ſiſter, liſten to S. Hierome, ſaying: To haue virginal fleſh auaileth nothing, if any one marrie in mind. To keepe corporal virginitie likewiſe is altogither fruitleſſe, if we refraine not our eies from concupiſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. Virginitie in bodie will nothing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, if charitie, or humilitie depart from the heart.</p>
               <p>Wherefore honeſt ſiſter in Chriſt I admoniſh you, that you remaine a
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:14161:103"/> virgin in mind and bodie. I admoniſh you likewiſe, that you take with you the oyle of good works, and with them adorne your lampe, and light it with ſacred vertues, that when a clamour ſhall be made: Behold the bridegroome commeth, goe ye forth to meete him; you may be able to meete Chriſt Ieſus your celeſtial bridegroome, and be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by him in the bleſſed bed-chamber of heauen.</p>

Such haue no reward, for that they haue not felt any laborious fight. But they ſhall haue glorie, that haue fought couragiously. For the fruit of chaſtitie is ſweetnes. Chaſtitie is the vnbleamiſhed beautie of the Saincts. Chaſtitie is the ſecuritie of the mind and the health of the bodie. Luxurie doth weaken the bodie, and cauſeth a man to become old and decrepit on a ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine.</p>
               <p>Long chaſtitie is reputed for virgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. And therefore venerable ſiſter, the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:14161:104"/> beautie of chaſtitie ought to be loued. Thoſe that are continent, and liue chaſtly, prepare in themſelues a dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling place for God almightie. Werevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Apoſtle doth affirme, that thoſe that liue chaſtly are the temple of God, and that the holy Ghoſt dwelleth in them. (1. Cor. 3.) Continencie maketh a man moſt neere to God. There God dwelleth, where continency remaineth. Chaſtitie linketh a man to heauen. Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitie conducted a man to a kingdome. The kingdome of heauen is promiſed to ſuch as liue chaſtly. Such as liue chaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſhall haue an inheritance in heauen. Coniugal chaſtitie is good: vidual conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie is better: but virginal integritie is beſt of all.</p>
               <p>A humble widow is better, then a proud virgin. A widow is better with humilitie, then a virgin with pride. A widow bewayling her ſinnes is more
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:14161:104"/> prayſe-worthy, then a virgin that vaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth herſelfe before men of her virginitie A widow lamenting her iniquities, is better, then a virgin extolling her ſelfe of her merits. A virgin ought not to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie before men of the guift of her virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie: for if ſhee doe ſo, ſhee hath no oyle with her: her lampe is extinquiſhed, a virgin ought not to deſpiſe widowes. A virgin that deſireth to pleaſe God, muſt not contemne woemen that liue cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtly: for if ſhee doe this, ſhee will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe God, and hurt herſelfe. A virgin that deſpiſeth woemen that liue chaſtly and ſerue God, is abominable for her pride. Why, what is the reaſon? Becauſe a humble ſinner is better, then a proud iuſt man. Deſpiſe not therefore (vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſiſter) woemen that haue come out of the world: that haue had husbands, &amp; haue brought forth children: becauſe if you deſpiſe them, you will be excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:14161:105"/> culpable before God.</p>
               <p>Anna the Propheteſſe had beene a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried woman: and yet ſhee prophecied of of Chriſt, and deſerued to ſee him (Luc. 5.)

You ought not therefore to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe, but rather to honour honeſt woe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who haue come out of the world to religion: for that it is not fitting, that you contemne ſuch as God hath choſen.

               <head>Of fornication. CHAPT. XXIII.</head>
               <p>MY deare ſiſter in Chriſt, I admoniſh you, that with all deuotion and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce you liſten to theſe wordes follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Lord Ieſus: * Let your loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes be girded, and candells burning in your handes. (Luc. 12.) We gird our loines, when by continencie we repreſſe the laſciuiouſnes of the fleſh. We hold candells burning in our handes, when we giue good examples to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boures. The fornication of the fleſh (as S. Iſidorus ſaith) is adulterie. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:14161:108"/> of the ſoule, is ſeruing of idolls. The darts of the eies are the firſt forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, the ſecond is of wordes: but he that is not taken by his eies, may reſiſt wordes All vncleame pollution is called fornication, although euerie one doth enioy ſundrie delightes of filthines. For from the delight of committing fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there ſpring vp diuerſe hainous ſinnes, by which the kingdome of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is ſhut, and a man is ſeparated from God.</p>
               <p>Among the ſeuen deadly ſinnes forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication is the greateſt: for that by the vncleannes of the fleſh a man doth defile the temple of God, and taking the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Chriſt, maketh it the member of a harlot. Wherefore honeſt virgin, if it be true, that God liueth in you, let for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication be dead in you. Luxurie is an enemie to God, and the deſtroyer both of heauenly grace, and earthly riches.
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:14161:108"/> Fornication doth not onely defile the bodie but alſo the conſcience. He that is laſciuious and lewd; allbeit he ſeeme to liue, yet he is dead. * Fornicators and aduoterers God will iudge, that is, will condemne them. Heb. 13.) Heare there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moſt deare ſiſter, the wordes of S. Iſidorus. To be defiled with fornication is worſe then any other ſinne. Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is greater then any other ſinne whatſoeuer. Fornication is a grieuous ſinne, fornication doth ſurpaſſe all euills fornication is worſe then death it ſelfe. It is better to die, then to commit forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, it is better to die, then to be defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with a ſinne ſo filthie: it is better to die, then by fornication to deſtroy both ſoule and bodie.</p>
               <p>Luxurie leadeth a man to the pit of perdition: luxurie drowneth a man in the helliſh lake of damnation: luxurie ſendeth a man to deſtruction. The eies
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:14161:109"/> are the meſſengers of fornication. The ſight is the firſt occaſion of fornication. For the mind is captiuated by the eies. The dart of loue entreth to the mind by the eies: the eieſight ſendeth the darts of fornication into the mind: the eie is the firſt dart of fornication. Wherefore deare ſiſter in Chriſt, repreſſe your eies: withdraw your ſight. Fixe not your eies on the beautie of the fleſh: behold no man with this intention, that you couet him: looke vpon no man with this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, that you carnally loue him. Gaze not vpon any mans face, that you may loue him amiſſe: Turne away your eies, that they ſee not vanitie: deſire not any mans beautie.</p>
               <p>Tell me, venerable ſiſter, what profit is there in the beautie of the fleſh? Doth not man wither and drie away as graſſe? and doth not his beautie flie away as a ſhadow? When death commeth, tell me,

All that is in the world, is the concupiſcence of the fleſh, and the concupiſcence of the e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>es. The world therefore for Chriſts ſake ought to be contemned, with all thing therein contained. But you ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt virgin (who for the loue of Chriſt haue left the world, and entred into reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion) ought not to be delighted in the beautie of men.</p>
               <p>I therefore counſel you (deare ſiſter
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:14161:111"/> in Chriſt) that aboue all things you loue Ieſus Chriſt your bridegroome, that you may be able to raigne with him in his heauenly kingdome. Certainely if the concupiſcence of fornication doth more delight the mind, then the loue of chaſtitie: it is a token that ſinne doth yet raigne in a man. But if the fairenes of chaſtitie doth more delight the mind, then the foulneſſe of fornication, it is an euident ſigne, that not ſinne, but iuſtice doth now raigne in a man. Although a man be chaſt in bodie, yet if he be laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uious in mind, it is apparant, that ſinne raigneth in his heart. Fornicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of heart is ſeruing of idolls.</p>
               <p>There is alſo a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other ſpiritual fornicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of which our Lord ſaith: * Whoſoeuer ſhall ſee a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to luſt after her hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie committed aduourrie with her in his heart. (Mat. 5.) Men are more made ſubiect to the diuel by the laſciuiouſnes
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:14161:112"/> of the fleſh, then by any other vice. Chaſtitie is the beautie of the ſoule, and by this vertue men are made equal in merit to the Angells of God. Beleeue me (louing ſiſter in Chriſt) many by the careleſnes of their eies, haue incurred the danger of their ſoules.</p>
               <p>A queſtion. Deare brother, tell me if you pleaſe, haue you knowne any man deceiued by the ſight of his eies?</p>
               <p>The anſwer. O venerable ſiſter, I know full many that haue beene deceiued by this guile, &amp; by this meanes haue beene caſt into the ſnare of the diuel.

               <p>Know therefore deare ſiſter, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men by meanes of their eies, haue fallen into danger both of their bodies ad ſoules.

                  </gap>ter, liſten to the wordes of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: ſaying: * Looke well to your ſelues, leaſt perhaps your heart be ouercharged with ſurfetting &amp; drunkennes. (Luc. 21.) The Apoſtle S. Paul, alſo by way of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending his diſciples, vſed theſe wordes. * Be not drunke with wine, wherein is riotouſnes. (Epheſ. 5.) Salomon ſaith likewiſe. * Wine is a luxurious thing, &amp; drunkennes tumultuous: whoſoeuer is delighted there with ſhall not be wiſe. (Pro. 20.) Behold not wine when it waxeth yellow, when the colour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:14161:118"/> ſhall ſhine in the glaſſe: it goeth in pleaſantly, but in the end, it will bite like a ſnake, and as a baſilisk it will power abroad poyſons. There is no ſecret, where drunkennes is. Wine hath deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troyed very many, and brought them into danger both of ſoule and bodie. * Wine was created for ioyfullnes, not for drunkennes (Eccl. 31.) Whereſoeuer fulnes doth abound, there luxurie doth domineere. A bellie that is ſtrouted out with meate and wine, hath commonly luxurie for his companion.</p>
               <p>Drunkennes weakeneth the bodie, entangleth the ſoule. Drunkennes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth perturpatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of mind. Drunke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes encraeſeth furie of heart. Drunkennes nouriſheth the flame of fornication. Drunkennes doth ſo alienate the mind, that a man knoweth not himſelfe. A drunken man is ſo alienated from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that he knoweth not where he is.</p>
               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:14161:119"/>
               <p>Many thinke it a praiſe to drinke much, and not to be drunke: whome the Prophet rebuketh, ſaying: * Woe to you that are mightie to drinke wine, and ſtout in drunkennes (Iſai. 5.) And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: Woe to you, that riſe earely to follow drunkennes, and to drinke euen vntill euening, that you may be enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with wine. The Prophet Ioel crieth out likewiſe, ſaying: * Awake you that be drunke, and weepe, and howle all ye, that drinke wine in ſweetnes. (Ioel. 1.) He ſaith not, ye that drinke wine in neceſſitie, but ye that drinke wine in ſweetnes, that is in delight.</p>
               <p>Drunkennes is a mortall ſinne. Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennes is a grieuous crime. Drunkennes is eſteemed as great a ſinne, as murther adulterie, or fornication. Drunkennes doth exclude a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the kingdome of God. Drunkennes doth expell a man out of Paradiſe. Drunkennes doth caſt a
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:14161:119"/> man downe headlong into hell. Noe with drinking wine was made drunke, and vncouered his priuities, which he had keept couered before by the ſpace of ſixe hundred yeares. (Gen. 9.) Lot alſo being drunke with wine, lay with hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>A Queſtion. Louing brother, is it a ſinne to drinke wine?</p>
               <p>The Anſwere. Venerable ſiſter, it is not a ſinne to drinke wine temperately, that is, with ſobrietie. For ſo the Apo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tle S. Paul ſaith to Timothy his diſciple. * Vſe a little wine for thy ſtomacke, and thy often infirmities. (1. Tim. 5.) Liſten likewiſe what Salomon ſaith: * Wine drunken moderately, is the ioy of the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:14161:120"/> ſoule, and the heart. (Eccli. 31.) Wine immoderately drunken, is poyſon. Wine without moderation ouerthroweth the vnderſtanding: troubleth the mind: ſtirreth vp luſt: encreaſeth, and nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth the ſame. For God hath giuen vs wine to recreate our hearts, not that we ſhould be drunke therewith.</p>
               <p>Wherefore honeſt virgin, let vs drinke, not as much as our ſenſualitie doth deſire, but as much as neceſſitie doth require. Let vs take heede, leaſt we conſume that in the vice of gluttonie, which God hath giuen vs as a medecine for our bodie. Let vs take heede, leaſt we turne that to the vſe of vice, which God hath giuen vs for the health of our bodies. Let vs take heede, leaſt we change the medicine of our fleſh, into the vice of drunkennes. Many by wine are made captiue to the diuel: neither is drunkennes any thing els, but a moſt
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:14161:120"/> manifeſt diuel. You therefore deare ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in Chriſt, drinke wine moderately, and it will giue ioy to your mind, health to your bodie. Drinke wine ſoberly without exceſſe, and it will take from you laſines and ſlouthfulnes, and make you ſolicitous and deuout in Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice. Why? Becauſe wine temperately drunken doth ſtire vp a man to prayer, and make him well diſpoſed in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of his Creator. Wherefore deare ſiſter, if you ſhall heare me as your bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and accompliſh all theſe things, as I haue ſaid, you ſhall by ſo doing ſhew your ſelfe wiſe and diſcreete.</p>

               <head>Of Sinne. CHAPT. XXVI.</head>
               <p>MOſt deare ſiſter, liſten to our Lord ſaying in the Goſpel: * Euerie one that committeth ſinne, is the ſeruant of ſinne. (Io. 8.) Sinne is committed two wayes, to wit, either through the loue of deſire, or dread of feare: when a man will either haue that which he doth deſire, or when he dreadeth to incurre the euill, which he doth feare. Sinne is committed fower wayes in heart, and as many wayes in worke. Sinne is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the heart by diuelliſh ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, by fleſhly temptation, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the mind, and by the defence of pride. It is alſo committed in worke,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:14161:121"/> ſome times ſecretly, ſome times openly, ſome times through cuſtome, ſome times through deſpaire. By theſe wayes then we offend in heart, and commit ſinne in worke. Sinne is committed by three meanes: to wit, by ig orance, by humane frailtie or weakenes, and by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrie, that is, of ſet purpoſe.</p>
               <p>By ignorance Eue ſinned in Paradiſe, as the Apoſtle ſaith: * Adam was not ſeduced; but the woman being ſeduced, was in preuarication. (1. Tim. 2.) Adam therfore ſinned by induſtrie or of ſet purpoſe, but Eue by ignorance. And he that is deceiued, ſinneth by ignorance; but he that conſenteth, by humane frailtie or weakenes. Peter ſinned, when he denied Chriſt for feare of a maid. It is worſe to ſinne throuh humane weakenes, then through ignorance. And a great deale worſe then either of theſe, to ſinne by induſtrie or of ſet purpoſe.
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:14161:122"/> He likewiſe that ſinneth publickly, offendeth more greiuouſly, then he that ſinneth ſecretly. He committeth a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſinne, that ſinneth in publicke: for that he both ſinneth, and ſheweth others how to doe the like. It is a certaine part of iuſtice for a man to acknowledge his ſinne, and to be inwardly aſhamed of the ſame. It is better and more laudable to abſtaine from committing euill for the loue of God, then for feare of hell. It is better likewiſe not to ſinne, then to amend the ſame.</p>
               <p>Euerie one that ſinneth is proud: for by doing things prohibited, he contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the commaundements of God. Heare therefore moſt deare ſiſter what I ſay, heare what I admoniſh: by one euill, many good things periſh. Keepe your ſoule from ſinne: He that offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in one thing, is made guiltie of all. (Iam. 2.) By one ſinne many good
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:14161:122"/> workes are loſt. Incline not your heart to that, where in your bodie is delighted. Permit not your ſoule to be in the power of your fleſh, neither conſent to carnal delights. Venerable ſiſter, * if you liue according to the fleſh, you ſhall die. (Rom. 8.) Wherefore cleanſe your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience from all ſinne: let your mind be pure: let your bodie be likewiſe purged from all miquitie, and free from all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puritie. Let no ſpot of ſinne remaine in your heart. The bodie cannot be defiled, vnleſſe the mind be firſt corrupted. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon in prayſe of the bridegroome (to wit Chriſt) it is ſaid in the Canticles: * His hayres are as the branches of palme trees, black as a rauen. (Cant. 5.)

Howbeit they are black as a rauen: becauſe although they eleuate themſelues to heauen by their vertues yet they alwayes acknowledge them, ſelues to be ſinners.</p>
               <p>So you, moſt louing ſiſter in Chriſt, albeit you liue well and religiouſly, albeit you ſerue God iuſtly and deuout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: yet I giue you this admonition, that

For the haires of the head are the cogitations of the mind, which are bound in conduites, becauſe they are bound vp in the holy Scriptures, leaſt they ſhould hang looſe and ſo be loſt.</p>
               <p>Kepe your heart therfore (venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble virgin) from all contagion of ſinne. Let no vncleane cogitation enter into your mind: let your mind be alwayes pure and cleane. For God doth not onely examine the fleſh, but the mind: God iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the conſciences of men.

There amend your fault, where it is ingendered, to wit, in our heart; expell the head of the euil cogitation from your heart. There offend, where you thinke that God is not. For before God nothing is ſecret. He ſeeth the things that are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, who hath made the things that are hidden and concealed. Our Lord is euery where preſent. The ſpirit of God filleth the whole world. The maieſtie of almightie God penetrateth all the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: there is no place without God. Our Lord knoweth the cogitations of men.</p>

               <p>Yes, deare brother verie willingly.</p>

All kind of lying ought to be auoided with great care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes: albeit there is a certaine ſort of lying, which is leſſe grieuous; as for example, when we lie for the ſpiritual good or ſaluation of others. But for that it is written: * The mouth of him that lieth, killeth the ſoule, (Wiſd. 1.) perfect men do with great care auoid this kind of lying: that they neither defend the vices of any one by their fallacie, nor hurt their owne ſoule, by ſeeking to doe good to an other mans bodie.

Defend not an other mans life by lying: no lie can ſtand with iuſtice or vpright dealing: euerie lie is in all men a ſinne: whatſoeuer is different from the truth or veritie, is iniquitie. Worldly lawes puniſh forgers and falſifiers: worldly lawes puniſh liers. If lying is condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by men, if falſhood be puniſhed in earthly courtes: how much more before God, who is witnes both of our wordes and workes?

As that man cannot lie, that ſpeaketh not: ſo he cannot forſweare himſelfe, that deſireth not to ſweare. Although a man vſe neuer ſo great art of wordes in ſwearing, yet God (who is the witnes of the conſcience) ſo accepteth the ſame, as he vnderſtandeth it, to whome it is ſworne.

And therefore venerable ſiſter, cut off from your to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gue the vice of detraction: do not backbite, blame, or (like a dogge) ſnaile at the life of other men.

Pride and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſnes are ſo linked togither, as that the one cannot be without the other.

Wherefore venerable ſiſter, take heede of pride, beware of being high minded. Why? Becauſe pride hath depoſed the Angells, depreſſed the potent, throwne downe the proud. * God reſiſteth the proud, and giueth grace to the humble. (Iam. 4.) I likewiſe

Yea, albeit an other mans tongue praiſe you, and not your owne: albeit an other mans mouth commend you, and not your owne: yet cenſure your ſelfe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your owne examination, not according to the opinion of other men.

               <p>The anſwere. Yes, deare brother, verie willingly, and I entreat you to tell me.</p>
               <p>Hearken therefore venerable ſiſter. If you will augment all your vertues, and not looſe them: hide your vertues for feare of pride and elation, hide your good workes for feare of arrogancie and boaſting. Seeke not to haue your good workes ſeene. Conceale your ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, diſcloſe your ſinnes, reueale your imperfection. Keepe cloſe your good workes. If you haue ſaid or done any thing that is good, neuer blaſe it abroad. As for your euill cogitations diſcloſe them with ſpeed. For a ſinne that is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed is ſoone cured: but a crime that is kept ſecret, is encreaſed if it lie hid, of little it becommeth great.

               <p>Wherefore honeſt ſiſter, let God at all times be the end of your intentions and actions. In all your workes reliè vpon his aſſiſtance.

The conſcience of a virgin ought alwayes to be humble and ſad: to the end, that by humilitie ſhee may not grow proud, and by profitable ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes her heart may not become laſciuious and lewd.

               <p>* SIxe things there are, which our Lord hateth, and the ſeuenth his ſoule deteſteth, to wit him that ſoweth diſcordes among brethren. (Prou. 6.) That man is accurſed that ſoweth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention among the ſeruants of God. He that breaketh peace and concord, doeth againſt God. He doeth Chriſt an iniurie, who among his ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts ſoweth enmitie.
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:14161:159"/> Why? Becauſe Chriſt is our peace, who hath made both one; to wit, Angells and men to be at concord and vnion. The concord of the wicked, is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarietie of the good. As we wiſh, that the good may haue peace: ſo we ought to wiſh, that the concord of the wicked may periſh. Concord to commit ſinne, is ill: but concord to doe good, to follow iuſtice, to ſerue God, is good and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable. We are gathered togither into one place for this end, that in the ſeruice of God we may all haue one ſpirit and mind. All that dwell in the houſe of God, ought to haue one ſoule, and one heart.</p>
               <p>It nothing helpeth to dwell together in one houſe, if diuerſitie of wills ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate vs God loueth vnitie of mind, more then vnitie of place: behold we are in this houſe many men, diuerſe manners, diuerſe hearts, diuerſe ſoules. One life,

For this reſpect like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, our holy mother the Church is ſaid to be terrible, as the armie of a campe ſet in array: becauſe like as the enemies are affraid, when they ſee an armie come marching towards them in battle array: ſo the diuel is affraid, when he beholdeth ſpiritual men armed with the harneſſe of vertues, to liue together in concord and vnitie.

               <p>MOſt deare ſiſter, let proprietie (which among the ſeruants of God is eſteemed a great fault) be neuer found in you. All things, which are in a monaſterie, are common to the whole communitie. If therefore the handmaid of God hath any thing proper or in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, whereof the reſt of the religious ſiſters are ignorant, it is plaine theft,

Becauſe ſhee hath all things in common with the reſt of Gods handmaides, and yet hideth ſome thing as peculiar to her ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe. To keepe any thing cloſely, and to hide it as peculiar to ones ſelfe, not common to the reſt of the handmaides of God: this I ſay is plaine theft, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant fraud. This is a great ſinne, this is the way to hell, this is the beaten way, by which theeues haue gone to the diuel. So much the Apoſtle S. Paul hath auouched: * Neither theeues (ſaith he) nor extorſioners ſhall poſſeſſe the kingdome of God (1. Cor. 6.) The handmaid of God, which ſeparatetth her ſelfe from the communion of the monaſterie, by reſeruing in ſecret to her owne vſe: muſt conſequently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be ſeparated from the ſocietie of eternal bliſſe.</p>
               <p>Many come to the common ſocietie
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:14161:183"/> of a monaſterie: But yet (which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not recount without great griefe of heart) all do not liue therein with that Euangelical puritie and perfection as is requiſite. In a monaſterie there are the holy Apoſtles of Ieſus Chriſt: there is alſo Iudas Iſcariote the betrayer of our Lord, and Ananias with Saphira his wife: there likewiſe is Giezi the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Heliſoeus. They therefore, that for the loue of God, and gaining of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting life, forſake all things which they haue in this world in imitation of the Apoſtles; ſhall reioyce with the ſame Apoſtles, and be rewarded with euerlaſting happines. But he, that after his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to religion, doth preſume to commit fraude in the goods of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſterie, is a Iudas, and ſhall ſuffer the puniſhment of Iudas in hell: for that, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>They likewiſe, who leauing the world, are conuerted to God, if in thoſe things which they had in the world, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue one part to themſelues, and giue the other part with themſelues to the monaſterie, they deſerue the ſentence of malediction with Ananias and Saphira his wife. But he that commeth out of the world to religion, if he deſire, or ſeeke to haue that in religion, which he could not haue before his entrance into the ſame, without doubt the leproſie of Giezi will adhere vnto him: and the leproſie which Giezi ſuſtained in bodie, he ſhall ſuſtaine in ſoule.</p>

               <p>Wherefore venerable ſiſter, do not you conceale, hide, or keepe any thing ſecret. Keepe nothing in hugger-mug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: hide nothing in corners.

               <p>Venerable ſiſter, * Before prayer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare your ſoule: and be not as a man that tempteth God. (Eccli. 18.) In prayer prepare your ſelfe, and lay open the hidden ſecrets of your heart, that you may obtaine greater grace from God. Then you pray truly as is fitting, when you thinke of no other thing. The iudge doth ſo much the ſooner liſten to the petition of a ſinner, if he ſee him amend his bad behauiour. Prayer ought to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed rather from the heart, then from the lippes. It is better to pray with the ſilence of the heart, then with meere wordes, without the intention of the mind. That prayer proceedeth from a pure affection, which is ſaid in his due time without diſtraction. For that mind is farre from God, which in prayer is buſied in thoughte of the world.</p>

               <p>BY prayer we are cleanſed from our ſinnes: by reading we are taught how to behaue our ſelues in our actions. Both of theſe are good, at times conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient. But if we want time to practice both, it is better to pray, then to read: for when we pray, we talke with God: when we read, God talketh with vs. Moſt deare ſiſter, if you will at all times conuerſe with God; at all times either pray, or read. Reading of good bookes is verie profitable and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient. For by reading we learne what to doe, of what to take heede, whither to tend. Wherevpon the Pſalmiſt ſaith:
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:14161:189"/>
* Thy worde is a lampe to my feete, and a light to my pathes. (Pſal. 118.) By rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding we grow to haue greater vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. Reading doth inſtruct vs to prayer, and action. Reading doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme vs in the actiue and contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue life. Wherefore it is ſaid in the Pſalmes. * Bleſſed is the man, that ſhall meditate in the law of our Lord day and night. (Pſal. 1.)</p>
               <p>Reading and prayer are the weapons, by which the diuel is vanquiſhed; theſe are the inſtruments, by which eternal happines is purchaſed. By prayer and reading vices are deſtroyed, and vertues are nowriſhed. The handmaid of God ought alwayes to pray and read. Wherevpon it is written in the Pſalmes. * Then I ſhall not be confounded, when I ſhall looke throughly in all thy commaundements. (Pſal. 118.)</p>
               <p>Wherefore deare ſiſter in Chriſt, giue
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:14161:190"/> yourſelfe often to prayer: perſeuere in meditation of the holy ſcripture. Let Gods law be your continual conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: be perpetually peruſing the ſame: vſe to read often; let the reading of Gods diuine law be your daily medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Reading, deliuereth a man from errour and falſhood, and withdraweth him from the vanitie of the world. By reading (as I haue alreadie ſaid) your wit and vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding will be encreaſed. For reading teacheth you what to doe, it diſcerneth, what you ought to eſchew; it ſheweth whither you are to tend. You profit much by reading, if you put that which you read, in execution.

(Cant. 8.) In our heart are cogitations, in our armes, actions. The beloued therefore is put as a ſeale vpon the heart and vpon the arme of his ſpouſe: becauſe it appeareth both by the will and action, how much he is beloued of a deuout ſoule, for that the loue of God is neuer idle. For if it be loue, it worketh great matters: but if it worketh not, it is no loue.</p>
               <p>I entre at you therefore venerable vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, that you loue God with a ſincere affection, and for the loue of him be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes doing ſome thing. If you loue God truly, you will neuer be idle: if you

He that loueth God with his whole will, doth for the loue of him loath to be idle. The kingdome of God will not be giuen to the followers of i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlenes, but to ſuch as are diligent in our Lords ſeruice. The kingdome of God will not be giuen to ſuch as gad or wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vp and downe, but to ſuch as labour for the loue of God, according to their vocation.

               <head>Of the actiue and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>platiue life. CHAPT. LIII.</head>
               <p>IAcob ſaw in his ſleepe a ladder ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vpon the earth, and the toppe thereof touching heauen: the Angells alſo of God aſcending and deſcending by it. (Gen. 28.) In this ladder are placed all thoſe that are predeſtinated to life euerlaſting: and euerie one hath a place in this ladder, that appertaineth to the kingdome of heauen. This ladder is the whole Church, which in part wageth warre as yet heere on earth, and in part raigneth alreadie in heauen.</p>
               <p>In this ladder are three rowes or
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:14161:201"/> rankes of men, to wit, ſeculars, actiues, and contemplatiues. Seculars are in the loweſt degree. Actiues are in a higher place. But contemplatiues are placed aboue all the reſt. And of theſe three rankes of men ſome are in the mill, others are in the field, and others are in the bed. The mill is a ſecular courſe of life. The field is the mind of a ſecular man. In the field are the preachers of Gods word. In the bed is the loue of the bridegroome, to wit Chriſt. They that are in the mill goe round about the earth, who ſeeke and loue earthly thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs. They that are in the field till the ground, who ſow the word of God in the eares of men. They are in the bed, who deſpiſe and contemne the world.</p>
               <p>At the foote of this ladder are worldly men: in the middeſt of the ladder are ſuch as are giuen to action: in the toppe of this ladder are ſuch as are addicted to
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:14161:202"/> contemplation, being as it were alreadie placed in heauen; for that they thinke on heauenly things. Theſe are the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells of God aſcending by the ladder; becauſe they aſcend by contemplation to God, and deſcend by compaſſion to their neighbour. The actiue life is inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie of good workes: the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue life is the ſpeculation of the things aboue. The actiue life is common to many, but the contemplatiue onely to a few. The actiue life doth diſpoſe of worldly things vertuouſly: but the contemplatiue life renouncing the world, doth delight to liue to God onely.</p>
               <p>A demaund. Deare brother, I entreat yow to ſhew me the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the actiue and the contemplatiue life.</p>
               <p>The anſwere. Moſt louing ſiſter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the actiue and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>templatiue life
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:14161:202"/> there is exceding great difference. The actiue life is to giue food to the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie, to teach our neighbour the worde of wiſdome, to correct ſuch as goe aſtray, to reduce the proud to the path of humilitie, to recall ſuch as are at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance to concord and amitie: to viſit the ſick, to burie the dead, to redeeme captiues, and ſuch as are put in priſon, to diſpoſe whatſoeuer is expedient for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one, to prouide whatſoeuer is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie for euerie one. Behold deare ſiſter in Chriſt, you haue heard the workes of the actiue life; now, if you pleaſe, you ſhall heare the vertues of the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>platiue life.</p>
               <p>The contemplatiue life is to haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect charitie with God and man, to reſt from external action, to adhere to the ſole deſire of our maker, and through the vehemencie of this deſire, to deſire nothing els whatſoeuer: to caſt aſide all
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:14161:203"/> the cares of the world, through an arde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t affection of beholding the face of God: in ſo much that a contemplatiue man knoweth now how to beare the burden of his corruptible fleſh (though not without griefe and anguiſh) and to wiſh with his whole deſires, to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent amidiſt the melodious quires of Angells, to couet to be admitted into the companie of thoſe heauenly citizens, and to reioyce in the ſight of Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> through the guift of immortal happines.</p>
               <p>Venerable ſiſter, you haue heard the actiue life, you haue likewiſe heard the contemplatiue life deſcribed vnto you now therefore I entreat, that with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Magdalen you chooſe the better pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="345" facs="tcp:14161:203"/> Whoſoeuer affecteth worldly glorie, carnal pleaſures, or any other earthly delectation, is thereby made vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for contemplation. Iacob may ſerue for an example vnto you of the actiue and contemplatiue life, who when he loued Rachel, that ſignifieth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templatiue life, had Lia giuen him to be his wife, which ſignifieth the actiue life.</p>
               <p>The actiue life doth ſerue God in the laboures of this world, by harbouring, feeding, and clothing, viſiting, confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and burying ſuch as are poore and needie, and by ſhe wing towardes them the other workes of mercie. And yet not withſtanding Lia is fruitfull in childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, becauſe many are addicted to action, few to contemplation. Howbeit Rachel by interpretation ſignifieth a ſheepe, or one ſeeing the beginning: becauſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templatiue men are ſimple and innocent
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:14161:204"/> like ſheepe, and void of all wordly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation: that adhearing onely to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine contemplation, they may ſee him, who ſaith of himſelfe: * I am the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, who alſo do ſpeake vnto you. (Io. 8.) Rachel hath two children, for that there are two ſortes of contemplatiue men. For ſome liue in common in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> others are addicted to ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarines, and liue requeſtred from all others.</p>
               <p>The contemplatiue life is more bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and perfect then the actiue. Like as the Eagle doth fixe her eies vpon the beames of the ſunne, neither doth ſhee at any time looke aſide, ſauing onely when ſhee deſireth to refreſh her bodie with food: ſo likewiſe holy men do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne from contemplation to the actiue life now and then: conſidering thoſe high things ſo to be profitable, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding theſe humble things in
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:14161:204"/> reſpect of our pouertie are likewiſe needfull. Wherevpon the bridegroome, to wit Chriſt, doth exhort his ſpouſe, to wit a deuout ſoule giuen to contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ticles, ſaying: * Ariſe, make haſte, my loue, my doue, beautifull one and come. (Cant. 2.) As if he had ſaid more plainely: Ariſe, make haſte my loue by faith and charitie: my doue by innocencie and ſimplicitie: my beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull one by vertue and chaſtitie. Ariſe from that your moſt ſweet bed, that is, from the contented reſt of contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in which you deſire to pleaſe me alone, in pſalmes, hymnes, prayers, and ſpiritual Canticles of deuotion. Make haſte therefore, and come: that is, come forth for the profit of your neighbour: that you may likewiſe cauſe them to become your imitators by the office of preaching, and vertuous examples, and conduct them to the ſaluation of their ſoules.</p>
               <pb n="348" facs="tcp:14161:205"/>
               <p>The viſion of the liuing creatures mentioned in Ezechiel, (chapt. 1.) which went and returned not, pertaineth to the perſeuerance of the actiue life. And againe the liuing creatures, which went, and returned after the ſimilitude of gliſtering lightning, do pertaine to the meaſure of contemplation, in which whiles euerie one doth bend his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, being beaten back through his owne fraile condition, he forthwith returneth downe againe. And againe the eie ſight of his mind being renewed, he aſcendeth againe to thoſe things, from whence he had deſcended, which in the actiue life cannot be done: from which if any one deſcend for neuer ſo ſmal a ſpace, he is forthwith enueloped in the filth of vice.</p>
               <p>The mind is often eleuated from the earth to heauen, and being oppreſſed through the burden of humane corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:14161:205"/> it deſcendeth downe from heauen to the earth againe. God viſiteth many worldly men, and by his grace eleuateth them to the height of contemplation: God likewiſe by his iuſt and ſecret iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gements forſaketh many contemplatiue men, being fallen downe to delight in earthly actions. Like as he that lieth buried in a ſepulcher doth ceaſe from all earthly care; ſo a contemplatiue man doth ceaſe from all worldly worke, or buſineſſe whatſoeuer. And euen as men aſcending from the actiue life, are as it were interred in the tranquillitie of contemplation: ſo thoſe that aſcend from a ſecular life to the actiue, a re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>receiued, and as it were buried in the ſame. And conſequently as the actiue life is the ſepulcher of a ſecular life, ſo a contemplatiue life is the monument of the actiue life.</p>
               <p>Holy men like as now and then they
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:14161:206"/> goe forth from the ſecrecie of contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation to vertuous action, ſo they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne againe from the actiue life to the cloſet of inward contemplation: that they may praiſe God inwardly, where they haue receiued that, which outward<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly they doe to his glorie. Like as God will that now and then contemplatiue men goe forth to the actiue life, that they may doe good to others: ſo now and then his will is, that no man diſturbe them, but that they repoſe in the ſecrecie of moſt ſweet contemplation: which the brideg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Howbeit aſlong as we liue in this world, no man can perfectly contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate God. Wherevpon S. Iohn ſaith in the Apocalyps: * There was made ſilence in heauen, as it were halfe an hower. (Apoc. 8.) For the ſoule of a iuſt man is truly termed heauen: like as our Lord ſaith by the Prophet: * Heauen is my ſeat. (Iſai. 66.) When therefore the reſt of a contemplatiue life is made in the mind, there is made ſile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in heauen, that is, in the ſoule of man; for that the
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:14161:207"/> noyſe of earthly things and buſineſſes doth ceaſe in the cogitation. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon in the ſame Canticles the ſpouſe ſaith of her ſelfe. * I ſleepe, and my heart watcheth: (Cant. 5.) as if a deuour mind ſhould ſpeake more plainely, ſaying: Whiles I outwardly ſleepe from world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tumults and cares, I inwardly medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate vpon heauenly and ſpiritual af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires.</p>
               <p>The arke of Noe likewiſe which is ſaid to haue had a double loft or vaute, doth ſignifie actiue and contemplatiue men: whereof the actiue ſtand below, and the contemplatiue aboue. And for that the arke is alſo ſaid to haue beene triple vauted (that is, to haue had three loftes one aboue an other) this doth inſinuate, that in the holy Church there are three orders, to wit, married folkes, bachelours, and virgins. Of this contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>platiue life our Lord ſaith in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel:

* If thou wilt be perfect, goe ſell the things, that thou haſt, and giue to the poore, and thou ſhalt haue a treaſure in heauen; and come, follow me. (Mat. 19.) And of Marie Magdalen he ſaith: Marie hath choſen the beſt part, which ſhall not be taken away from her. (Luc. 10.) The contemplatiue life ſhall not be taken away in this world, neither in the next. But the actiue life ſhall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away from a man in the world to come. The actiue life hath an end in this world, but not the contemplatiue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it continueth for euer.

Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie ſaith: We ought by ſo much the leſſe to conſider other mens hearts, by how much we know that we are vnable
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:14161:209"/> to bring to light the darknes of their thoughts. Alſo S. Iſidorus ſaith: We more eaſily carpe at other mens vices; then conſider their vertues: neither are we curious to know any mans good, but enquire onely what euill he hath committed.</p>
               <p>Wherefore my beloued ſiſter in Chriſt, I giue you this admonition, that you be alwayes more readie to reprehend your owne faultes, then thoſe of other men. Rather looke vpon your owne imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, then thoſe of others. Be carefull of your owne correction, be ſolicitous of your owne ſaluation, be prouident of your owne amendement: be not inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitiue into other mens affaires, neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to know what men ſay amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. Seeke not to know what other men ſay, or doe. Beware of curioſitie. Trouble not your ſelfe about the life of others, let no curioſitie deceiue your
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:14161:210"/> mind, let no deſire of this deteſtable vice ouertake you vnawares, leaſt forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting your owne manners, you curiouſly conſider thoſe of others.</p>
               <p>O ſpouſe of Chriſt, correct your owne fault with as great circumſpection, as you are car<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Be not enquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue about thoſe things, whereof you ought not to enquire: let paſſe as a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, what you haue learned by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the holy ſcripture. Seeke no more, then what is written, ſearch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter no more then what the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do ſet downe? neuer deſire to know more then is ſitting.</p>

(1. Thes. 5.) And Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſaith: * There are iuſt men and wiſe, and their workes are in the hand of God, and yet ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> knoweth not, whether he be worthy of loue or hatred. (Ecc. 9.) Why, what is the reaſon? Becauſe all things (ſaith he) are reſerued vncertaine for the time to come.</p>
               <p>Deare ſiſter in Chriſt, for this cauſe our Lord hath concealed from vs the time of his comming, that we through long expectation being vncertaine, ſhould at all times beleeue the true iudge to be approaching, for that we know not, when he will come. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon S. Gregorie g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And therefore deare ſiſter in Chriſt, it is verie expedient, that at all times when we doe any thing that is good, we call to mind the euill, which we haue committed: that whiles we aſſuredly know ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For this cauſe our Lord would haue vs ignorant of the end of our life, that we might alwayes ſtand in feare thereof: that ſithence we are vnable to ſee it, we might daily prepare our ſelues for it. S. Iſidorus likewiſe, leaſt we ſhould thinke our ſelues ſecure in this life, doth admoniſh vs, ſaying: Neither let a iuſt man truſt in his iuſtice, nor a ſinner

<pb n="372" facs="tcp:14161:217"/> (Prou. 14.) * He that deceiueth the iuſt in a wicked way, ſhall fall into his deſtruction: and the ſimple ſhall poſſeſſe his goods. (Prou. 28.) * Men of blood hate the ſimple: but iuſt men ſeeke his ſoule. (Prou. 29.)</p>
               <p>Holy ruſticitie is onely profitable to it ſelfe, and aſmuch as it doth edifie and doe good in the Church of Chriſt by the merit of life, ſo much it doth dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edifie and doe hurt, if it doth not reſiſt thoſe that gaine-ſay the truth. S. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome likewiſe ſaith: In the ſeruants and handmaides of God attire of bodie is not to be expected, but ſimplicitie of mind. Let neither a ſimple man, nor a plaine honeſt man thinke, that ſanctitie doth meerely conſiſt in ruſticitie of ſpeech, but onely in a pure and ſimple conſcience. Of two imperfections it is better to haue a holy ruſticitie or rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, then a ſinnefull eloquence. A ſacred
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:14161:217"/> ruſticitie is more praiſe worthy, then verbal loquacitie.</p>
               <p>Deare ſiſter in Chriſt, if our intention be ſimple and ſincere before God, our actions will not be ſinfull nor obſcure in his ſight. They that know not how to be chaſt by iuſtice, cannot be innocent by ſimplicitie or plainnes. The Saincts and ſuch as are elected, begin the way of righteouſnes and ſimplicitie with feare, but end with charitie. For God is not onely a beholder of our wordes, but alſo of our heart, and loueth them that ſerue him in ſimplicitie of heart. Wherevpon the bridegroome ſpeaketh in the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, ſaying: * My doue is one, my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect one: ſhee is the onely to her mother, the elect to her that bare her. (Cant. 6.) Our mother is the regenerating grace of God, which chooſeth one doue onely: becauſe it onely collecteth thoſe, that remaine in ſimplicitie, and are not diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:14161:218"/> from vnitie. For many faithfull aſlong as they attend to God, aſlong as they cheriſh one an other through one deſire of Chriſt, aſlong as hauing one heart and one ſoule they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ioyne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in charitie, of many members they make one bodie, in which liuing all in ſimplicitie of vnitie, they remaine one doue onely.</p>
               <p>Thoſe things which men contemne and deride, are in great eſtimation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God. Let vs therefore venerable ſiſter, deſire almightie God to ſend downe the holy Ghoſt from heauen vnto vs; who may make vs to haue the ſimplicitie of the doue, and the wiſdome of the ſerpent, that we may be ſimple in malice, and wiſe in good workes. For the ſerpent is a craftie creature, as we read of the Aſpe in particular, who ſeing the inchanter comming, putteth one eare cloſe to the ground, and with
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:14161:218"/> his tayle ſtoppeth the other, to the end he may not heare the voyce of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanter. Where vpon the Prophet ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of cruel men, and ſuch as are wiſe in wickednes, vſeth theſe wordes. * They haue furie according to the ſimilitude of a ſerpent: as of the Aſpe that is deafe, and ſtoppeth his eares: which will not heare the voyce of the inchanters and of the ſorcerer inchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting wiſely. (Pſal. 57.)</p>
               <p>Do you therefore (moſt louing ſiſter) imitate the ſerpent in this point; that is, ſhut your eares, that you heare not euill wordes. Honeſt virgin, beſeech almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God, that the oyle of a ſinner may not fatte your head. (Pſal. 140.)

The ſerpent doth ſhut his eare, that he may not heare the inchanter: do you ſhut your eare in like manner, that you may not heare a ſlaunderer. The

Therefore to ſome, temporal paine is as a purgation to purge them from their ſinnes: but the damnation of ſome is begunne heere, and their perfect perdition is prepared there. Some are iudged in this world by tribulation: others by the inquiſition of the ſtrict iudge ſhall be iudged by fire in

Heerevpon Iob ſpeaking of God, ſaith: * Both the innocent and the impious he conſumeth. (Iob. 9.) For the innocent is conſumed by God, when his verie inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie being clearely examined, and compared to the innocencie of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth nothing in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon thereof. The impious alſo is conſumed by God, when by the ſubtilitie of the diuine exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, his impietie is ſought for and ſifted, and iuſtly condemned.</p>
